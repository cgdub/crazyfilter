My younger daughter - now diagnosed with Asperger's but at the time just considered a bit different - hated school from 2nd grade. When she was 15 I was still having to persuade her every morning to go and finally one morning when she said she wouldn't go to school, I said "okay". She thought a bit and then decided on her own that it was more trouble than it was worth to stay home. She was old enough to see that missed work would have to be made up, class notes would have to be copied, excuses written. Although she still didn't like school, there was no longer an argument every morning - which relieved both of us.
I don't think anyone should be allowed to give an opinion on Syria unless they can find it on a map. Above all, Congressmen.
Why is raising the cost of sending all these catalogs never suggested as a solution? Two birds with one stone - who needs a new catalog every week (all those trees cut down) and more revenue. And all the demands for charity - our mail is 75% letters asking for money and very often 25% catalogs - it's very rare to get a real letter these days but such a pleasure when we do. Why is it so cheap for the people trying to get more of our money (charities and catalogs) ?
My daughter and I just discussed this over the weekend. When she was born 35 years ago, I was told to always put her down in her crib on her stomach to prevent SID. At the birth of her first child 5 years ago, she was told to ALWAYS lay the child down on her back to prevent SID. It seems that SID has actually decreased since parents have been told to do this so perhaps this time they got it right - but we were given opposite advice with equal firmness. 
We live in Minnesota - lots of beautiful, quiet evenings! 
I had an abortion when I was a stupid 20 year old college student. I have never, absolutely never, regretted it. I regret very much being stupid enough to let myself get pregnant. I regret the lack of sex education in school, the lack of communication with my parents, the lack of initiative on my part but I never regret the abortion. I have been a school teacher for many years and an unwanted child, unprepared mother and judgmental society are a recipe for disaster.
I'm a mother of two bi-lingual, bi-cultural children - English speaking mother, French-speaking father living in France. The two learned English in completely different ways but you're right - it is hard work for the parent. What kept me going was the thought that the American grandparents wouldn't be able to communicate with their French speaking grandchildren. Another remark - our second daughter didn't say a word of English until she was past three when she began to speak in paragraphs - everything had been recorded in her brain although we weren't aware of it. I think that true bi-lingualism only comes with actually living in the country - both my children went to English universities although a firm base should be established before puberty. Don't make it a battle - keep reading English books, get lots of input - there's no excuse now with all the DVD's, music, etc. Persistence pays off.
On a recent flight, a passenger dropped his telephone between his seat and the wall. It took 45 minutes to get it out. Because it was on when it was dropped, we couldn't take off until it was retrieved. I admired the crew for following the rules - reassuring in some way - but also, everyone knew there was no real danger and somehow, missing connecting flights seemed more important to some of us.
Parts of this story could have been us - living together but separate addresses, basically getting married to keep the parents happy, the very non-eventful marriage - we had forgotten to plan anything to eat so our 10 guests piled into the subway to go to a restaurant someone knew about. Our honeymoon was with another couple who conveniently had a car. And we have been married 40 years. The spectacular event marriages of today bother me - so much time and money invested.
Carol Goldstein, let it go. He was young and so were you in 1967. It was a different era. I hope you don't really believe that everyone at West Point in 1967 was a "war-mongering beast". If so, you need to listen to people talk about that time. It was full of contradictions, everything was not black and white. It's easy in retrospect to simplify the problems of the time.
In the 1980's, I was on a cortisone treatment for 2 years. I was given a sheet of paper listing foods I shouldn't eat because they had sodium in them. I followed the diet to the letter but soon found myself having strange muscle spasms and cramps. When I saw my doctor again, he said that although they give the diet to everyone taking cortisone, no one ever followed it strictly - this was in France. And adding a bit of salt to my diet eliminated the muscle spasms and cramps.
In my case, it was  true - when my children were born, they became my absolute top priority. Their lives put everything else into perspective and yes, indeed, I lost my killer reflexes, although I'm sure it doesn't happen to all women. I can't help feeling that it would be good if the same thing happened to men - a bit of perspective could change the way business is done in a good way. It is a pity that society in general doesn't value children nor parenthood as much as it should.
I had an ambulatory blood pressure device recently and found it to be very anxiety-provoking. The noise every 20 minutes of the cuff inflating kept me from any kind of sleep - after a night of being awoken every 20 minutes, I was near hysteria. I'm probably more sensitive than others but have found taking my own blood pressure at home regularly works much better. It has also reduced my anxiety in the doctor's office - I think part of the high blood pressure in the doctor's office was the anxiety that he would find I had high blood pressure. Knowing that it was normal elsewhere somehow helped keep it down. 
I've always thought that "bed rest" was just a way of saying "slow down". Many women lead lives which are much too hectic for a risky pregnancy and telling them to stay in bed means they have a reason not to go to work and maybe get a little help from people around them. 
We have friends who sold everything in order to buy a travel home. Their idea was to take photos and write a blog about their travels. It turns out that they hated every minute of it. They missed having a base, didn't like the other travelers they met, didn't like the camps. This, of course, takes nothing away from this article about a woman who knew what she wanted, had already tried living in a foreign culture, and seems to have been lucid. She makes it seem easy but it isn't. Know yourself.
I'm sorry - your reaction was to offer a solution - a bit difficult to enforce though. 
How about working a bit more on teaching men that it's not acceptable? Look around you at movies, commercials, billboards - they seem to give permission for this kind of behavior. U.S. "culture" seems to be aimed at hormonal young men for whom any kind of behavior is okay - violence, sexual assault, piggish eating habits....
Your lack of understanding is breath-taking. What woman has "overwhelming" force against a man whom she probably won't see until she has begun to react? For having been groped at least 5 times - each incident different - I know there's always a moment of disbelief - maybe it's an umbrella, maybe it's just the movement of the train? before the realization that indeed it's what it feels like. In a crowded train, it's difficult to change position, turn around, get a good look at the idiot.<br/>I just re-read your closing lines - do you have a wife, daughters, sister, mother? Run the paragraph past them and see what they think.
I too live abroad and have aging parents. I return home more and more often - 8 hours of transatlantic flight, 4 hours of car - as they get older and travel less. I feel that the really important visits are while they are still alive. I try to stay for at least two weeks and I cherish these visits and think they do too.  I'm obviously privileged to be able to do this. If I miss being at their death bed, as I probably will, I think I will still consider these visits as more important.

It sounds to me like these guys watched too many American movies and thought they were an accurate reflection of American life. As an American living in a foreign country, I found this was often a problem - they think we all walk around with guns, shooting anybody we're not happy with, having to duck flying bullets as we do our weekly shopping, crashing cars into police cars - think of the last violent movie - or more likely, the last movie any 20 year old male acquaintances liked since current movies seem to be aimed at that age and gender.
I've only read the first page of comments but many of them are very similar to the comments on Amazon.  A certain community of people is very vigilant and are surprisingly coordinated in their attacks on the author and her book. Interesting.
Reading about the differences between doctors and nurse practitioners, I'd prefer the nurse practitioner any day. This does raise a few questions though - why are nurses paid less for doing the same job as doctors? Why will they go where doctors refuse to go? Doctors don't come off as the kind of person I'd like treating me - unfortunately this has been proven in real life. A pity.
I'd like to know how he explains this to his children and wife. Okay, everybody did it but he lied constantly to everyone - possibly even to himself. As soon as I had children, I stopped cheating at anything - I couldn't even say they were only 10 instead of 12 to get a cheaper movie ticket - because I couldn't lie in front of my children.
I am convinced that acupuncture saved my life - I was being treated aggressively for a lung disease for the second time, having relapsed once before. I continued the treatment while seeing my acupuncturer. The side effects were greatly reduced, I stood the treatment much better and was physically and mentally stronger during the treatment. One important aspect of it was the holistic approach - I wasn't just a diseased lung. Being listened to and treated as a person can never be underestimated. 
Not sure we're going to see another great performance from De Niro, seems like he's been mailing it in too many times the last several years, probably will continue to do so.<br/><br/>Have to agree about scheduling, seems like some of those summer flops might have done better if they came out now.
I used to race in triathlons and I have to say, I always feel better after a run, far better than a swim or a bike, though I enjoyed all three equally, just that running always made me feel better.
That's a foolish argument Rick, "the more Americans have died in their bathtubs" argument, how many times have our bathtubs killed 3,000 Americans on one day?<br/><br/>It's that threat I'm worried about, regardless of the number of times it has happened.
But one thing the article doesn't discuss and you don't discuss either when making your point is the elephant in the room: illegal file sharing.<br/><br/>How much of an impact has the billions taken out of the movie industry by illegal downloading of movies on file sharing sites had on Hollywood?<br/><br/>It's safe to say that any discussion about the economics of Hollywood is not complete without considering the billions taken out of the industry by download.
The article points out that the casino version is not designed to learn an opponents style but to make the optimal play at each stage.<br/><br/>Moving from one machine to another does not provide the player with an advantage.
Five million copies of "Sgt. Pepper" seems low though?
What's the impact with file sharing?  Hasn't that taken a huge chunk of money out of the industry, money that could be used to finance more writers and directors?<br/><br/>I don't think you can download movies illegally and then complain about quality.
Some of this stuff is just unbelievable: here's the guy who's been accused of being socialist yet somehow names Tim Geithner and Larry Summers to critical positions for our economy.<br/><br/>I think one of the best lines I remember from the attacks and sums up how fruitful this anti-Obama stuff is (paraphrasing): "While they hunted down his birth certificate, he was hunting down bin Laden."
Li Na is fierce but she has great sense of humor, it's too bad that's not captured too well in this article, but it's a good article overall.
Politicians cashing in?<br/><br/>Sorry, what's the story here?  What's remarkable about this?
Yikes!<br/><br/>A little too racy for the "Times" methinks.
Finally, she reviews a movie without poor attempts at fancy word play or comparing the movie with a hundred other movies or every one of the directors other movies.<br/><br/>She's still a terrible reviewer but at least this time we get what we read movie reviewers for: a movie review!
I can't think of anything more productive than leaving the work place and not doing work for longer periods of time than any other group of people at the same work place as leading to higher productivity.<br/><br/>Sure, taking breaks is important as it gives the brain a chance to 'recharge' but why should one group get longer breaks than another, especially for the same pay?<br/><br/>Smoking makes you more productive, you argue?  Nicotine gives you 'peak performance'?  Why don't we hear employers pushing us to smoke to increase productivity?  <br/><br/>Certainly the productivity gains would offset increases health care costs.
Great article, shows what a drag smokers are on the economy and this has an impact on all of us.<br/><br/>Add these costs to the costs required to clean up all those cigarette butts smokers throw out their car windows or toss on the ground and the overall costs to the economy are huge (clean up costs for cigarettes estimated at over a billion I read somewhere).<br/><br/>I can't understand how smokers can just litter like this, we have a beautiful country and they litter like there's no tomorrow.<br/><br/>I don't buy the argument of cars not having ash trays: get a can and drop your cigarettes in there, then put the can into a barrel, what's so hard about that?
Foolish comment, have you read the article?<br/><br/>This athlete is making effort to learn the language and culture.
I'm surprised at all the negative comments here, not sure where all the negativity is coming from, just the story of an athlete trying to adjust to different culture, learning the language, just a human interest story, that's all.<br/><br/>The article doesn't convey any sense that this athlete is pampered or "high falutin" or anything like that, so not sure why so much negativity.<br/><br/>When you have to travel to different country for work and don't know the language, it's daunting, so you have to try to assimilate as much as possible.<br/><br/>She'd come off as completely arrogant if she didn't bothered to do the work to learn English and just hired a interpreter.
Yep, we worked out math later (discrete math was many years ago) and wouldn't be feasible, to say nothing about the time of actually buying all those tickets.<br/><br/>Another good reason we buy lottery tickets only once or twice a year.<br/><br/>It would be interesting if this reporter published similar story on casinos and the elderly (or anyone else foolish enough to step into a casino).
If you do "beat the odds" and win a lottery, why not take the money and re-invest it and buy tickets for all possible numbers the next time the prize pool gets high again, there's no way you could lose?<br/><br/>So, if you win 100 million, I think if you then choose every possible number, I'd think you have to invest 18 million (I'd have to do out the math) for this the next time the pool rose to 400 million, if you have to pick five numbers.<br/><br/>While it's possible you would have to split the pool with someone else, since you purchased all numbers, if the lottery awards prizes for hitting six out of seven, five out of seven or whatever number, you'd have considerable return on investment. <br/><br/>If you don't have to split the pool, it's huge return on investment, one that you could repeat since you'd have more than enough money.<br/><br/>I don't think this is illegal, not sure, don't play the lottery that often, but if I did and win, no one else would ever win again.
While this is great for the newspaper industry, you can't forget how much Amazon is fighting to pay any kind of tax.<br/><br/>Why can't this company that's making hundred of billions of dollars in profile give in on taxes, it's terrible for our country?<br/><br/>Your argument is taxes are too high, is it?<br/><br/>Go and read the Times' series on "But no one pays that" on corporate taxes, I'm sure Amazon shunts money all over the world to avoid paying any taxes or reducing it as much as possible.<br/><br/>Here's the founder of this company, a founder who benefited greatly from the American educational system and personally made billions but his company fights tooth and nail on any type of tax.<br/><br/>We need more Warren Buffetts and fewer Jeff Bezos, in my opinion.
Can't say this enough, but go see "Fruitvale Station" while it's still in theater, great movie.
Nice article but where's the reports of "A-Rod" taking steroids in high school and the minor leagues?<br/><br/>This is well known, not sure why it's not brought up here.<br/><br/>I'd be surprised if all the players on the team did not show the same behavior attributed to "A-Rod" in this article.
I agree that anyone caught doping should be fined or suspended, the more penalties the better, what's the point of sport if you're cheating.<br/><br/>What I don't understand is why teams don't put in clauses that gives them clawback or   the possibility of terminating contracts if player X they sign is caught cheating or doping.<br/><br/>That's not possible?  Think of all the money the Yankees would have saved.
Everyone should see this, really fantastic, a hard punch to the gut.<br/><br/>The ending was fantastic, one of the most powerful scenes I can recall in a while.<br/><br/>This is a great review too.
Probably if you're going to T.G.I.F, you wouldn't know good from bad (food, drink) anyhow.<br/><br/>With all due respect.
That's great news that Paul Greengrass directed this, I was aware of the movie but wasn't aware he directed.<br/><br/>He's made several fantastic movies: "United 93" (though difficult to watch given the subject), "Bloody Sunday" are certainly two of the best in recent memory.
All I know is that when my friends visit from outside NYC, Uniqlo is higher on their tourist list than the Statue of Liberty. Simply opening their website to orders would make them a boatload of dollars. Malls are dying, Uniqlo. Develop your website!
It's also become a cliche to ignorantly diminish someone's hard work on an anonymous message board. "His little picture book" is being funded through modern crowd sourcing techniques. What is wrong with that? And "paid placement"? Do you mean to imply that this is an advertisement? I simply can't conceive of you as anyone other than a smug 17-year-old who knows very little of how the world works.
This show used to be brilliant. Not anymore.
Worth noting: Prime Meats' weekend brunch is a great alternative. Served until 3pm, I think. Best bacon in the borough!
Why would they need anything other than metadata, considering the content of the Web is generally static? The metadata (time, date, location, etc.) is the dynamic part of the analysis. They could easily cache a copy of, for instance, web sites and know what everyone is looking at -- the metadata is the identifying information needed for specific examination of those poor souls who happen to visit that site. Apparently the only "reasonable expectation to privacy" we have left is when we're dead in a coffin. Phone calls might be different, but if there is any aberration in your behavior (say you give a call to someone new) -- they will compare it with past instances through their bizarrely insane large databases and note that "something is up." Whether that something that is up involves you switching dentists or plotting mischief is entirely ambiguous to a computer that just sucks everything up with no discretion. I guess the one saving grace is that they don't record the content of phone calls yet, or atleast they haven't admitted it.
Excellent and timely analysis.  One can add many other examples but you have captured the most appropriate ones.<br/>During my active service with quite a bit of travel, I used to count a few hours in a plane as entirely my own without any iPad, smartphone or even TV.  Even my boss had to wait until I landed before often altering my objectives for my travel at the last minute.<br/>Not anymore.  I am not only in my own cocoon everywhere, I am also expected to be accessible all the time.<br/>While meandering from my main lecture in the class, I often talk about the pros and cons of delegation.  The example, I give is that if Columbus had GPS or a smartphone, he would have never discovered America! Instead he would have bought lot of spices and silk from India!
As a world leader, US does have the responsibility to intervene when some unjustified atrocities are being carried out by any country.  It makes it more tragic if such acts are directed towards one's own people.  Syria has had casualties exceeding 100,000, all totally unnecessary.  Particularly tragic and gruesome are those using chemical weapons.<br/>While all this was happening, learned columnists in all leading papers as well as opposition leaders were prodding the President---often with personality attacks--- that the President should intervene; however now that he has announced his near-term action, the very same learned columnists are suddenly arguing from the other side!<br/>More troublesome logic is that we associate our decision to intervene with the means of death. For a parent, a lost child via traditional bombing is as big a tragedy as via more gruesome means.  Thus taking a very limited action just to "punish" for a specific type of action will not have any long term impact; on the contrary it will bring more animosity towards us! 
I have read Post for over thirty years and it is an indispensable part of my morning pot of tea. Since I largely work from home now, once I am at my desk, I read the selected articles from the daily NYT email.  These two sources of news pretty much make me current with what is happening here and around the world.  I particularly read OpEd columnists from both papers.<br/>There are a few areas where NYT wins by a margin, its email access is smooth and has rarely a glitch whereas the Post website is clunky still, difficult to navigate and its daily emails still not useable.  However, NYTs Op-Ed is not balanced when it comes to political leanings. Its magazine wins by a wide margin.<br/>Reading on the computer screen has many advantages including larger fonts when needed at my age. But it cannot take the place of a paper I can hold in my hand while taking my morning pot of tea.  Therefore I need both.<br/>I have high hopes that Mr Bezos will make Post web access truly smooth and world class.  Of course, he may have many other surprises for us!
Reading some of the comments below, I am amazed that we often tend to look any commentary through either a political or business-interest lens. I am not expert enough to support or refute the assertions in the above article.  If other experts do not agree, they should give links to peer-review scientific articles correcting the statements above.<br/><br/>Pending that, I have to say that we have "discovered" a bad solution to energy needs.  This is definitely taking away attention from renewable resources.
How difficult it is to get everybody a voter ID card?  Why can't we combine it with driver's license?   In these says of instant debit and credit cards, can we not make it feasible for even the poorest to walk to the nearest public office and get their card?<br/><br/>Finally, when will we make it feasible to vote online?  Already about 70% of the population can do it, perhaps with the help of their 10-year child or grandchild if needed. 
For several decades, US healthcare system has excelled in advancing the medical technology but has always lagged behind other developed countries in terms of costs as well as universality.  Finally now, we have a chance to rectify the latter.  For the life of me, I do not understand why anybody would oppose it.   Instead we should have a nationwide competition for the best ideas to make it even better.  Let us lead in this field also.<br/>Oh yes, I  forgot one little thing: political imperatives.  Please divert that energy to something else and away from the most precious thing we have: our health.
Distressful as this stalemate is, the heart of the matter is that all issues are subordinate for our politicians' desire to get elected with legally allowed financial help from interested parties.<br/>I can think of three measures that can break this deadlock:<br/>1. Ban all political ads on television. ( Follow the rest of the world)<br/>2. Make all elective offices a single-term appointments<br/>3, Make gerrymandering illegal and redraw district lines using latitude and longitude lines.<br/><br/>Without such steps, every step forward will be stopped one way or other 
You have written a wonderful summary that obviously comes from your heart.  Underlying each and every line is that in life what matters more is how the people around you judge you and not who you really are in your heart.<br/>This is a global phenomenon that has taken various forms throughout history.  At some places and times, entire nations were enslaved for centuries; at other points we standby and let millions of children go hungry while at the same time we pay farmers not to grow more food.  A person of your talent can add to this list many other instances.<br/>What is the way out?  We sometimes feel that the answer is staring at our face but we still do not have the courage to do it. At other times we are just too busy with our own demons.<br/>In this moment of despair, we are fortunate that we have also people like Bill Gates who continue to push against the wind.  We should have more of them
A very good summary of a complex subject.<br/>I am not a doctor nor a drug developer. However, a family member's lung cancer has forced me to study this  topic as much as possible.<br/>Overall, the process is deeply flawed and driven by large commercial interests.  The argument goes like this: we cannot do expensive research unless we have big sales. Therefore one generation of patients are trial mice for the next.<br/>Now to some specifics that completely shook my confidence in this industry when I understood it.  A phase 3 trial is considered a success if the group taking the drug has a median survival rate as low as 4 months longer than the other group taking placebos.  It means two things:<br/>1) All participants have to die before results are published---that is why older patients are preferred;<br/>2) With the average age of mortality now above 80 years, is 4 months extra with pain and anguish worth the expense?<br/>So what is the alternative?  As a care giver and not one with medical background, frankly I do not know.  But one thing I can say after 50 years of professional experience in other industries:  no other high tech industry even at the cutting edge works this way.  Their criteria for operational use are much clearer and unambiguous.  And they sell their products at the same price worldwide.
Another sad part is that while we sincerely want to eliminate race from our society, our system is still designed to keep this stratification based on how one looks. Countless forms, including Census, election results all include race in one form of another.<br/>No wonder our young people make judgements based on such external factors and appearances.<br/>If we really wish to eliminate this, start from deleting all race based questions in government and other forms.  There are only two legitimate questions:  your gender and whether you are a legitimate citizen.  
Economists believe that their discipline is alone responsible for solving economic crises and most of the time they are correct.<br/>However, this time it is technology that is responsible for not allowing us to get lower unemployment.  The extent of automation is so pervasive that we have an uphill task.<br/>One possible solution is a large scale apprenticeship scheme.  That is how Germany has always kept unemployment low, in spite of the burden of other crises around them.
We have to face the fact that technology is introducing automation at such a pace that on our present path, we may never see reduction in unemployment.  In other words, this is not a fiscal or monetary issue alone.  One way out is to introduce a large scale apprentice scheme where young people acquire skills of tomorrow.<br/>Of course, this will again get mired in "too big a government" argument.  How about big companies that are reaping benefits of rising stock market setting aside funding for apprenticeship scheme?
When I was a boy in middle school, the British were still ruling India. My father used to often lament to us that everything ----down to sewing needle----had to be imported from the UK.  Pioneers like Gandhi tried to change this through Satyagraha, among them wearing homespun clothes and mining the salt right in India. It had an impact on the policies.<br/>Today cities like Amsterdam have more bikes than people and that is reducing fossil fuel consumption. In addition to alternative renewables, we need mass movements all over the world protesting against excessive fuel consumption. Those who can bike should do so; rest can at least refuse to buy gas guzzlers simply to show muscle on the road. That is the only effective message that corporations will hear.   
In my dictionary, the word "Mutt" is derogatory when applied to human beings.  The alternative definition in Wikipedia is "mongrel".<br/>I have a simple question.  In the early waves of immigration ( mostly from Europe), the definition "Mutt" was not used presumably because the new immigrants looked like the old ones.  So why use it now?  Since the article is not entirely pessimistic about the future I wish some other alternative definition had been used that was not tied to color or looks, but to culture, cuisine and countless other attributes that flourish when diversity expands a nation. 
Probably I am in the minority of one in what I am going to say.<br/><br/>*Our Maker did not design our bodies for same sex marriage. <br/><br/>*Marriage is an age-old institution for children to be  conceived and grow in a safe, familiar environment.<br/><br/>*At the same time, we know that certain persons have different sexual urges. But that is not new and is entirely different from what marriage is for thousands of years.<br/><br/>*Lastly federal privileges are legal issues and should be handled on merits and separately.
Yesterday, I happened to listen on the PBS an interview with the British Minister in charge of the Universal Health Care in that country. I recommend listening to it, not only for the very productive discussion on key issues of the present and the future but also by the depth of knowledge and clarity of understanding of the political, financial and human implications of decisions in this field. In fact, he appeared to be equally knowledgeable about the similar issues in this part of the world!<br/>On the substance, he underscored that UK will soon be the leader in digitalization of medical records for each and every citizens in that country. Listening to the discussion, I wished that we would finally move forward from the politics ( we have done it for decades now) and focus on modernizing our health care delivery system for all, While it is credible that we have several centers of medical excellence, we are still way behind in universal care, with everybody in the chain (from 911 paramedic onwards) capable of looking at our entire medical history on portable devices. 
The column ignores two critical differences:<br/>One, English language gives US manufacturers an unparalleled chunk of market with disposable income;<br/>Two, in developing economies, the paramount need is to first meet basic needs of the vast majority and not necessarily encourage "consumption" for its own sake.  Rice and vegetables do not necessarily need "branding"; availability at affordable prices is the key.<br/>As economies emerge from depressed stage, they become ripe for "branding"; South Korea is a prime example. After decades of struggles to meet its basic needs, the brand "Samsung" is now giving a fierce competition to Apple and others around the world.
Our country traces all decisions and mistakes to the president, much more than in parliamentary democracies where the heads of different branches are also elected by the people and are therefore generally bear the ultimate responsibility for any mistakes.<br/>Given our system, we need a president who does not act in a hurry but carefully examines all options before saying or doing anything that cannot be reversed.  In my view, Obama is superb in that respect compared to last 4 presidents.  It is much better to have a deliberative president than the one who acts too quickly on the last advice they receive on a topic.<br/>At the same time, the President has to also do better public relations. He is great in times of sorrows and disasters but once in a way he should open up to the public sharing with them his internal thinking in a soft and open manner.
Excellent review that clearly highlights the obstacles.  However, no country ---big or small--- has progressed without a truly internal enthusiasm as the main force. Once internal momentum is built, they should identify what they need from other countries.<br/>Over centuries, totally externally imposed order and systems have never really succeeded.
Good but quite a bit pontifical!<br/>Every bit of complexity, loop holes and vagueness in the IRS code is due to Congress.  Therefore, before we throw too many stones, we should also examine if the apparent bias in the implementation of certain clauses was mainly due to the inherent complexity and vagueness handed down from those who are sitting in judgment now
Extra marital affairs by otherwise highly regarded individuals, executives and politicians are as old as humanity. What I am intrigued by is that in these days of electronic wonders, why has nobody come out so far with a cardboard cut-out of Nancy Pelosi connected real-time to IBM Watson?  It will be then an equitable debate format and may even create a new employment opportunity for young programmers!
A very useful survey of which you have given us a few snippets.  I am nearly 80 years old and here are a few thumb rules that I can think of on this subject:<br/># A child gets self confidence if he meets the expectations of his parents.  A child loses self confidence very quickly if he is constantly being compared with an older sibling who is doing better in school or sports.  As one school headmaster told me: "never fight nature.  Nature does not create only brilliant children and remember "normal distribution" applies to everything".<br/># an young employee loses confidence if he or she is not given the opportunity to lead a project because of being too young; on the other hand nothing creates better life long confidence than a public appreciation by a senior executive. Just look at the faces of spelling bee winners!<br/># A young idealistic rising employee loses self confidence if he finds that only way to get ahead is to do personal tasks for the bosses and to cover up any corrupt practices.<br/># And finally, an executive who has done extremely well all his life, loses all mojo and confidence if he is bypassed due to being too old.<br/><br/>Bottom line:  life is a mixed bag. If you succeed phenomenally or have a precipitous fall  at any stage, try not to dwell on it too long.  Remember, nothing gives you more inner confidence than honest handwork at any stage of your life.
A very good review with an optimum combination of scientific facts and human touch.<br/>I wish we would have more such articles on other types of cancer, notably lung cancer that kills far more people than any other type.<br/>What frustrates lung cancer patients and care-givers ( like me) is that any discussion of lung cancer starts with smoking ( an implicit accusation that it is your own fault), even though less than 20% of lung cancer is due to smoking now.  I cannot say that lung cancer will become less severe if there was more funding, but their are virtually no campaigns, no ribbons of any color.<br/>A more general comment on cancer drug approval process.  A new drug costing as much as $100K per year is approved by FDA if the trial shows 2 to 3 months of increase in median survival rate.  This looks like a ridiculously low bar for "success"compared to any other scientific research.  No wonder that despite a succession of expensive trials with new drugs, the overall mortality rates are not dropping.  A two-month extra life with your dear ones is important, but it is only a blimp in the way mortality rates are calculated. 
The root cause of many troublesome trends in our society is the lure of TV contracts.  All sports teams get rich on such contracts.  Politicians need massive amounts of money to advertise on TV during election campaigns.  Drug companies advertise on TV, especially during dinner time, spending money that they get back by extremely high prices for drugs.  And so on.<br/>While it is hard to justify not allowing young people to watch top level sports, we can certainly eliminate the other two as most other countries do.
Lot of good stuff here.  However, you missed out the most valuable part of university education.  This is the ability to ask yourself the right questions.  If you acquire this ability ( or already have it), this ability will distinguish you from others long after the stuff you were taught in school has become obsolete. Success in life is not being able to just dominate a meeting, but to create new ideas, concepts and products.  You will succeed if you have the ability to ask the right questions.  That is what distinguishes a graduate from a top university and the one that is only a diploma machine.
"Wonderful. At the end I kept wishing it would continue."<br/><br/>me too. A wonderful tribute to what two people can promise and deliver to one another. A reminder to me to take what I have a little less for granted. 
Yes, I too was left with the question, "what part of 'gift' don't you understand?" The only part of this article I understand is that gifts must be acknowledged. 
Internationalizing the job market for STEM graduates in the US will, in my opinion, have one strong and direct effect -- reducing the value of those degrees to native-born Americans. Native born Americans, who get no value from the granting of the green card on earning that degree will be incentivized to move their interests to a field where they won't have to compete with workers who are, effectively, getting additional compensation (the green card) for their degree. <br/><br/>So, expect fewer Americans in science and tech and more moving towards MBAs, law school, and medical school. Is that the goal? 
Foolish decision. I hope they backtrack. 
"Fertility declines with age. This is a fact of human biology, not a conspiracy of the medical establishment against older women. "<br/><br/>Yes, and the doctor who was telling you at 40 that you had no time to wait was not being ageist, she was accurately reflecting the data. A more recent study that reflects the effect of aging on the liklihood of bearing a child with one's own eggs using current technology is Malizia et al 2009, NEJM. In it, the best/worst case scenarios for &gt;40 year old women becoming pregnant using IVF (which circumvents some issues that affects infertility) was 20-40%. Aging of eggs is the culprit, and the same women can often be successful bearing children with donated eggs. Currently, medicine does not have a good way to address the aging of eggs. <br/><br/>Women need to have access to this information from their doctors. The fact that egg quality declines at a fairly early point in aging and that modern science hasn't had a significant effect on retarding that decline is something that women need to know. 
I can't tell you whether you did the right thing or not, but I do know it was your decision to make. 
But the key to BMC's model is that it's relying on the partially regulated market place: that insurance companies must pay to treat individuals who choose/or are taken to out-of-network hospitals. This NJ law (do other states have it?) gives the hospital leverage that is unmatchable by the insurance companies. We want emergency rooms to treat patients and we want insurance companies to pay, but there's an imbalance here. A way to correct might be to include a required reimbursement patients are treated out of network. 
Why, why should the president propose the cuts? He's proposing the tax increases that would prevent the cuts he doesn't want, along with the cuts he's willing to stomach. <br/><br/>If the Republicans want to do it differently, they need to propose the cuts, without the tax increases that balance the budget. 
I think this probably comes off better when you're being amazed about something that isn't part of the "rat race" (i.e. not grades, or when they learned how to read, or what contests they've won), but as in your example, their kindness or fashion sense or something else that isn't part of the competition. And, in the case of kindness, something that doesn't get clear credit. 
Spot on. I honestly love to hear the shared joy of others. That could range from a four year old's first soccer goal to a struggling child's first victory to a  17 year genius's Intel win. If it's the joy being shared, I want to hear about it and I'll be happy for you. 
"they have convinced themselves that the opportunities the feminist revolution won for women can be sustained without unrestricted access to abortion. "<br/><br/>But they are wrong. The feminist revolution occurred in conjunction with the ability of women to control their fertility (which includes access to abortion). Further, the sustenance of  an anti-abortion movement that is not tied to gender inequality relies on the continued access to reproductive choice, which we have in this country, and have had as long as the movement has existed. 
True, that we don't have to stay in our apartments all the time.  Unlike elephants and big cats, though, I'd suspect that chimps have no greater need for space than humans do. 
I, too, would like clarification on the "1000 square feet". The number does seem off to me. Maybe they mean 1000 cubic feet (including height)? Otherwise, it does seem ironic if humans can live in 250 square feet but chimps can't. 
"How do we structure sanctions against Iran to cause the greatest psychic humiliation? "<br/><br/>Why would we want to do this? And, in relation, asking the question this way shows the problem with using social psychology as the starting point in policy negotiations. Social psych might tell us how best to get a result we want, but first we actually have to agree on the result. In the case of Iran, I've heard the opposite, as well, that the goal has to be giving Iran a way of backing down *without* causing psychic humiliation, that causing psychic humiliation increases the possibility of war and nuclear bombs (which are a pretty good defense against humiliation against all kinds). <br/><br/>The same debate about the debt. For example, you and Paul Krugman (an economist, whose opinion I trust more) have different views on whether we should "manipulate" people into revamping the role that debt plays in our economy (at least right now). <br/><br/>I'm all for using what knowledge we have of behavior to increase our possibility of reaching our goals, but that knowledge is mostly peripheral to setting the goals. 
Are there any reasonable Republicans in the house? Not a rhetorical question. Are there any? 
I thought of this fantasy, too, that Israel turn around and voted in favor of the resolution -- as everyone points out, it is a symbolic vote with no practical effect. They could have cast their vote in favor, and said: ok, now let's negotiate the borders. Can you imagine? <br/><br/>Not taking that path does really make one wonder what the Israeli endgame solution is.
Though parents certainly should act like parents, the problem cited here, that kids can lie to join Facebook, and then, information about their friends becomes public, even when the friends are minor children, isn't clearly a problem that can be solved by individual parents acting like parents. <br/><br/>Even if all of them did, the ubiquity of computer access pretty much prevents parents' controlling their children's online choice (unless they follow them around all the time, which, in turn would have its own negative consequences). 
Someone in the Republican party needs to talk about the Asian-American vote. Obama won it 75/25. Clinton lost it 30/70. What "gift" did Asian Americans get? Romney is delusional. I'm frankly disbelieving that he ever ran a business.
I would have thought this article a spoof, if I'd seen it in email. 
My 9 year old was watching the returns in Washington with shock, because he simply couldn't understand why 40% of people would be voting against marriage. He's nine, and an optimist, so he's easily shocked by injustice. It doesn't make any sense to him at all that people would tell two people they can't love each other. And we have a hard time explaining it to him. Really, trying to explain the issue to him is like trying to explain why some people might believe the earth is flat. It just doesn't make sense to him at a fundamental level. <br/><br/>He is also the future. "The arc of the moral universe is long but it bends towards justice." There is no turning backwards on this issue, and we have to keep fighting to bring it forward. 
"1) The Public Editor has explained why Nate Silver's column isn't quoted in Times articles, but hasn't explained why the Times relies on misleading national polls in its stories on the presidential race. "<br/><br/>And, Nate Silver isn't the only statistician out there doing statistics on polling. They could acquire/have as a consultant a statistician who could provide mathematical advice on all articles using statistically complex data. I know the journalists try to find such sources when writing articles, but having a "stat editor" like a copy editor to address the issues would be useful. 
I don't see why this is an issue at all -- recognizing talent, in any endeavor, celebrating success is a good thing not a bad thing. <br/><br/>At the same time, we can be sure not to exaggerate the success that has been achieved. Scoring well on a standardized test means you've done just that. It doesn't mean you're the smartest person in the room. <br/><br/>And, it certainly doesn't mean that you are a more valuable person. Celebrating achievement shouldn't mean that we value the person (the successful or unsuccessful one) by their achievement. That's the lesson we need to teach our children, not that everyone is the same, or that some people aren't better at something than others, but that the value of a person is independent of this achievement. 
I waited until our daughter was six to pierce her ears, and in the Pacific Northwest this was considered very forward. My own ears were pierce at 3 mo, in India
My rule about this is to say no when it makes me feel bad to say yes. I write my own boundaries. Depending on the child, her friendship with my daughter, my friendship with the person asking, my activities, I may or may not agree. <br/><br/>There's another issue when you worry that the person is in serious need. Someone I know took on a co-parenting role for a friend of their child's because they couldn't turn the other way when they knew that the child (not the parent, necessarily) was in need (the mother was  mentally ill). I have not encountered such need in my social environment, and that in itself speaks to the burden that others face. Even in serious circumstances, though, it is not your responsibility to take on if it makes you feel bad. You have to own the responsibility and decide saying yes makes you feel better than saying no. 
I myself am wondering about framing an acceptance letter. Really? Is this something people do? and if so, who? and for which colleges?
I've lived in NYC my whole life and there have been MANY larger snowstorms right around Valentine's Day. Off hand I can think of five 1983, 1996. 1998 (or 99) 2005, and 2011. This is neither historic or catastrophic, I'm a whole lot more concerned about the fact that it doesn't snow like it used to. 
As a skeptical Brooklynite I moved to Queens after I got married because this is where my husband grew up. I must say after several years living here I no longer think that this is the borough where people go to die. The food alone is enough to keep me here without complaint, and places like the Museum of the Moving image serve as the icing on the cake.
Just more things to add to the list I'm sure the idiot mayor keeps in his lapel....if you aren't rich you don't matter. If you don't live in Manhattan you REALLY don't matter. 
I refuse to buy any books from Amazon, just because of their willingness to manipulate prices (which they only do because they can).<br/><br/>If this settlement ends up forcing BN out of business, I'll toss my Nook ereader and go right back to reading conventional books purchased at a bookstore and NOT through Amazon.
Give me a break. I'm an adult. When I want ADULT time with my ADULT friends I don't want to go to a bar and have squirming screaming children around. The problem really is the inattentive self absorbed parents who would much rather be checking their Iphones and drinking a beer instead of being parents and disciplining their children. I am so tired of saying the same thing about people with kids. If things in your life are too important to give up than maybe it is time to rethink the idea of having kids. Otherwise you need to pay attention and discipline them so that they don't aggravate the other ADULTS around.<br/><br/>I'll put a nce checkmark next to Greenwood Park as a place that I do NOT want to go.
My office building is overdoing it with the AC. It is FREEZING.
Does this mean no more Maury (please God).
Just another example of Bloomberg treating New York City like his own personal Sims game. This man will not be content until he has legislated EVERY aspect of our lives as New Yorkers. His grandiose belief that he knows whats best for everyday people is so egotistical, and of course very Big Brother-ish.  Yes, obesity is a problem but if people want to keep pouring large sugary drinks down their throats, let them have at it. Their is no reason for the City government to be involved. 
Thank you for writing this article. I'm still in denial that ABC cancelled "All My Children" and "One Life to Live" for really bad daytime talk shows. I started watching soaps at around the same time you did, with my older sister who watched the entire ABC lineup when "Ryans Hope" and later "Loving" were still included. I learned so many things about life (maybe a romanticized over the top version of it) from soaps.<br/><br/>I can remember so many summer afternoons spent languishing at home watching Jessia and Angie, or Greg and Jenny, Delia, Tricia Forbes, Erica Cane, Max Holden, Gabrielle... gosh the list goes on and on. Would I trade any of them for reality tv today (Snooki and the Kardashians et. al.)? Not a chance. I've turned my television off permanently in my own version of a protest. <br/><br/>I hope ABC regrets this decision, although I know that there is nothing that they can/ will do to rectify what they have done.
I am so tired of hearing people blaming everyone but themselves for eating an unhealthy diet. For all of the people in America who sit around eating fried foods and getting no excercise, they pretty much deserve what they get. You can not blame Paula Deen for peoples laziness, for not seeking the information about healthy eating that is readily available (or eating not so well IN MODERATION) and not getting up off the couch. I feel bad for Paula; you can't blame her for peoples utter lack of motivation to do ANYTHING. 
This has got to be one of the truly DUMBEST articles I have ever read in the NYT. A few people got sick, likely from eating contaminated flour. Yet this is enough to cause a frenzied response calling for people to stop eating cookie dough? 
Does his abuse of the office really surprise anyone? All of these Bloomberg cheerleaders need to take a step back and look at how he has conducted business for the last ten years. This is just a culmination, and all I can do is shake my head and wait with bated breath for the next election.
It should be Latoya, Tito, JACKIE, and Marlon.
It's hot. It's July. I've lived through plenty of summers just like this. As much as I believe that climate change is a problem I don't think that a normal summer heatwave is somehow indicative of the end of the world. I wish peopl;e would stop treating it that way.
May he find the peace in death that he never found in life.
I love winter running. Although I run all year round its winter that I look forward to. There is something about the silence and the cold that I absolutely love. All I need is a good pair of gloves, a face mask and a hat. 
Mine only went up a few dollars...you need to shop around.
The problem we have is that the right wing really does hate government,<br/>and does want to shut it down. All the rest of us can carry on, wonder how<br/>they can do what they're doing, etc. but this is what they want. And they're<br/>going to get their shutdown, and it's going to go on for awhile. And then we get to<br/>the debt ceiling debate and they will push that too, over the brink if they have<br/>their way. This is where we are.
They would only view it as a scarce commodity<br/>because they can't afford it.
I was the surrogate for my Grandmother and had to make an end of<br/>life decision for her. It was extremely difficult but, she had told me<br/>in no uncertain terms, more than once, that she didn't want any<br/>artificial measures to be taken,and she was also clear about what<br/>measures she was talking about. This was a great gift to me during a<br/>very emotional time, and one I was very grateful for.
So the delightful Liz Cheney is challenging a sitting Senator who<br/>thought he was good friends with her father, tries to blame a clerk<br/>over a mess up with her fishing license, and now throws her sister<br/>under the bus so as not to disturb the sensibilities of any future voters<br/>who may not be too keen on gay marriage. Very tone deaf start to her<br/>political career.
sherr29, if I lived in NJ I would not be voting for your Governor for many of the<br/>reasons you outline. My question is why, in a state that generally supports<br/>Democrats, Mr. Christie is expected to handily win re-election?
I kinda like Christie, but his schtick is already getting kinda old. Really can't<br/>imagine him as the President of the United States of America.
Miley Cyrus, age 20 plus Robin Thicke, age 36 equals gross.
Just wondering how much State Senator Schaaf pays for his health insurance?<br/>Oh that's right, the state, meaning the taxpayer, picks up that tab for him.<br/>Interesting how easy it is for some of these guys to be all high and mighty with<br/>their so- called principles when it doesn't cost them a cent.
Well, apparently we're all now self-loathing if it makes you feel any better.
Wow, this column was kind of convoluted. But, yes, Paul McCartney is still<br/>terrific, no disagreement on that point.
Very funny (love that show)!
Do you think the law mandates that everyone has to buy an individual<br/>policy even if they already have one through their job, etc?<br/>If not, then your analogy makes no sense.
My mother had Alzheimer's for 15 years before she died of this horrible disease, and your narrative was spot on. Thank you.
I pay almost $600 a month with a $5000 deductible just for myself.<br/>Insurance bought privately is very expensive.
That's what the GOP said about Social Security and Medicare.
You mean like now?
Really?
Okay, you all have convinced me I needed this cookbook.<br/>Ran out, bought it, just poured myself a glass of wine and have<br/>settled in for a good read!
Well, apparently not. Almost 800 people have commented thus far,<br/>Including you.
Yes, and probably get her elected.
Being that Mitch McConnell is up for re-election in 2014 he might want to avoid talking about the Golden Girls in a negative way. I suspect they're still a lot more<br/>popular that he is.
And this from a man that thinks a women takes a birth control<br/>pill every time she has sex...you know, like Viagra. For a man<br/>married four times he's either not paying attention, or not asking<br/>any questions.
And why don't you support Obamacare?
I think all the items are for sale in a thrift shop or resale store<br/>and grouped together to create some interest.
I am reminded of the scene of great rejoicing ,in Gone With the Wind" when the news of the firing on Ft. Sumter brought great rejoicing. We all know how that turned out.
To Robert Brown<br/>Nothing is going to stop the ACA. It will start , on schedule , on Tuesday, Oct. 1.That's the pity of this entire charade-- people like you have been bilked by the Republicans. If the shutdown continues and the government defaults due to the Republican's reckless behavior, there will be negative consequences for them.<br/>" Most Americans are rejoicing..."? Hogwash.
Mr. Culbertson said it all " Like 9/11, let's roll". It is a mockery to suggest that his actions are akin to those who attempted to thwart the hijacking.
To Know It All-<br/><br/>So we either get rid of the ACA or we shut the govt. down or we don't raise the debt ceiling. Why do we need elections? Why pass law?. Let's just propose an alternate course of action, at the last minute, after many votes to defund a law that has already been funded. Let's not forget to throw in the Republican economic platform of 2012 into the mix-- Obama needs to be reasonable, and he should accept what the R's want and, if he doesn't--well, he's pigheaded.<br/>I am reminded of what Lincoln said in 1859 at a speech at the Coopers Union. The South had said that they would secede  if a Republican were elected. The South had threatened to secede on other issues, also enumerated in that speech. Lincoln made the analogy that the South's position was like  a highwayman who says that if you are shot because you refuse to hand over your money, you will be at fault, not him. Judging from the comments of reasonable people , it's easy to see why extortion works.
To Andrea E<br/>What specific questions have not been answered? 
What, exactly, are the lies.? Most of the misinformation comes from articles like this. R's continue to fabricate "fact" like this article and her reference, for example, to Avik Roy's so-called figures.
More right wing talking points without a shred of evidence. I always wonder how such nonsense gets past the moderator when my nonsense doesn't.
Perhaps governments around the world could emulate the US Congress for non-partisanship. We certainly don't spend " precious time and resources on public relations to convince people through misinformation and misdirection to be ignorant" of laws.
   I thoroughly enjoyed Mr. De Martino's article on Sicilian  politics. Sicily , unfortunately will not change, sine the system of corruption  appears to be too ingrained. We are talking about a couple of hundred years of Mafia influence. My grandparents were born in Sicily and I have made five visits. I have always felt safe there and have never been threatened in any manner.<br/>   There was an incident in Palermo the last time my wife and I were there. About four or five people, two were handicapped , refused to allow traffic to move at an important intersection, near the train station. Traffic was held up for over an hour and a melee ensued between two of the traffic stoppers and a motorist.<br/>The motorist was beaten as his wife screamed "they are killing him". He jumped back into his car. The police, on the scene did nothing to help the man or to get the traffic moving again. My understanding was that these people wanted payment to allow traffic to move again.<br/>   The incident is reflective of the problems that face Mr. Crocetta since most on lookers just shrugged their shoulders, indicating that this is the behavior expected from the police.<br/>   I love Sicily and will return this Spring.
Have you ever noticed how many professional athletes who command a high salary whine when the are subject to criticism about there performance? They just don't get the respect that they deserve.
$31 million per year figures to be about $300,000 per RBI or about $ 3 million per home run. I don't blame him for trying to get as much as he can, it's called capitalism. The issue is whether anyone is dumb enough to pay him that much.
What exactly do the critics of this agreement think we should do? We could always go to war so that we can have peace.
Munich indeed. Seems like many of those commenting need a history lesson. Also, it's always interesting to see those who want to do" something more" to Assad, but when Americans are asked their response is to stay out of it. We have had several apples out of that bag and that is quite enough , thank you.
   What a misleading article. Ms. Turner quotes Avik Roy's article as the basis for her assertion that rates will increase "97 to 99 percent for men and and for younger women by an average of 55 to 62 percent." As Paul Krugman and Ezra Klein and others have pointed out, Roy's figures are bogus. Klein points out that not only is Roy comparing apples and oranges, he's comparing " oranges that you cannot even buy.<br/>   Next, in paragraph six, Ms. Turner says that the subsidies will be paid for by higher taxes and higher deficits. What about the benefits gained through lower health costs?<br/>   Finally, Ms. Turner uses a series of talking points used by Conservatives without citing her sources.<br/>   Will there be glitches in the program? Of course. Will they be addressed? Certainly. Ms. Turner is arguing that there should a delay to address such issues. Why haven't the Republicans addressed these issues in the past? The reason is evident--they are in favor of repeal and not improvement. We had an election that focused on healthcare and we know  how that turned out. 
     I am amazed to read this column in the NY Times. First, she cites a work by Avic Roy as for the basis of her contention that Obamacare costs will be higher than those projected by the CBO. Ezra Klein generally refutes the argument made by Mr. Roy in a face to face meeting with him. Next, Ms. Turner states that subsidies aren't free and that they are a dead weight on the economy. Not exactly, if health costs go down the more money will be available to spend in the marketplace. Last, of course there are going to be glitches and these will be addressed as the program moves forward. Ms. Turner can't resist adding Republican talking points about millions of employers cutting hours when facts don't match her rhetoric.<br/>     We had an election and among the important issues was Obamacare --and we know who won that.
To Mr. David H Eisenberg<br/><br/>I agree with you. I find that, as you read the commenters about this article and about what we should do, many have a axe to grind , have a conspiracy theory readily available or affix blame based on ideology.
Let's see--- Morsi is elected in Egypt in ,apparently, free elections  However, he is dumped by the military and this is a good thing because it is better to dump those who are duly elected because a military regime is the lesser of two evils. It seems like only those regimes whom we favor should be allowed to exist rather than those who are elected.
I would think that the term "moderate rebel" is an oxymoron.
President Obama did the right thing in not sending arms to the Syrian rebels and that decision was proven to be correct based on this article. To say that "Obama and Co. " is responsible for the extremists  is simplistic and an exaggeration. I am reminded of the 1950's when President Eisenhower refrained from giving Hungarian rebels support against the USSR. He was criticized in this country by zealots who thought that we should have become more involved.
Exactly which leadership did you have confidence in and when?
To Jp<br/>How do you know that it is a disaster since it has not been fully implemented?
I did not know that  problems in the ME started in 2009 . Apparently, everything was going great until President Obama took over. It's obviously his fault that he extended a hand to Rouhani  who snubbed the President. Also, how dare President Obama not bomb Syria and work with the Russians to get control of Syrian chemical weapons. Don't we understand that trying to work with people leads to nowhere. We need more of" you are either with us or against us" thinking and  react accordingly . I wonder what Ms. Dowd proposes that we do - since she knows what we shouldn't do.  
Exactly .Most  have forgotten how our invasion of Iraq was going to lead to a democracy in the center of the region which would reduces the influence of Iran and we would be greeted  as liberators. Mencken said something to the effect that no one ever won a bet by betting on the intelligence of the American people. How quickly we forget how we got here .
Obama " created chaos in the Middle East". Invading Iraq, of course, had nothing to do with the present situation.
<br/>Sure, we should have bombed the Syrians or better yet, put  boots on the ground. The Saudis will never acquire nuclear bombs. As for Israel, when have they ever done anything that has helped US foreign policy?
There are two sides to this murderous sword. One is obviously the infringement of our fundamental right to leading a dignified and private life and second being<br/>the possible disastrous consequences of this information falling into the hands of psycho cyber criminals. I sincerely hope that we derive that ultimate benefit of protecting our right to life from being taken away by terrorists thanks to this utilization of this tool by NSA. 
I am deeply saddened by this huge loss suffered by the small businesses on the Jersey Shore. The fact that they rebuilt this after Hurricane Sandy only to tragically lose again to fire is an epic blow. I hope and pray that the NJ Government gives them a helping hand along with Banks to refinance their very lives. 
I agree with each and every word of this article written by President Putin. This is a remarkably well communicated message to the American people. President Obama always came across as a man who clearly spoke his vision and his heart out. But somehow that element in his character was missing while dealing with the Syria crisis. We must clearly weigh the future risks while drawing a short term strategy. We do not want any more enemies now. It is in our interest that we convey an image of America as an understanding and respectful nation without being judgemental of other regimes in a humiliating manner.
An Elitist Musician who never played for the poor Indian masses. He was extremely talented but prefer to entertain either the super rich Indians or the Western audiences. A sad day for lot of limousine liberals, but  masses will not miss him because he never existed for them.
There are a thousand struggling playwrights in NYC waiting for that one opportunity and we keep bestowing these jaded 'popular' writers with unlimited number of chances. Time to inject some fresh blood and renew Broadway to the current times.
A lot of us ordinary people think that only the Top Management of an Investment Bank gets ridiculously rewarded financially and the general employees are just like us. As an IT Professional I can vouch for the fact that many White Board Solution Architects, Business Analysts with 2-3 years experience, Junior Quality Assurance Engineers, Project Managers with no American Experience at all make well over 130K Per Annum and the total Cost to those Companies including 401K, Benefits, Bonus can easily come close to 180-200K Per Annum. Their contribution to the society in terms of positive productivity or the overall well being humanity is no way proportionate to what any of them makes. Needless to say, ultimately the huge cost of these parasites is upon all of us powerless, hardworking and honest folks.
Another Trader, Another Inquiry!
Rajat Gupta is now being hailed in my home country India as a hero. We treat corrupt scamsters, crony capitalists as triumphant souls. Rajat Gupta is now being welcomed back into India to take charge of a High &amp; Mighty Office and join his corrupt Brothers in Politics. Had Rajat Gupta not migrated he could have been a bigger scamster in India since we do not have Rule of Law and only reward such heinous crimes.
I am not able to comprehend our Justice System, if a person steals 3 candy bars on 3 different days then he would be in for 20 years under the 3 strike rule. You scam billions in insider trading you just get 2 years. Something is amiss here...its not right.
@Mark...The algorithms used by those HFT computers are changed on an hourly basis by Traders using some descriptive programming languages. Computers do not come from factories pre-installed with all the HFT algorithms, they change by hour and minute and all of them are specified by Traders using Rule Engines.
Oil of Olay will have good market in this Island! They seriously need some moisturizing and skin nourishing creams.
Just wondering ! What might be the average death age of High Frequency Traders?
Longevity is all pre-destined and wired into the DNA of one' s body. I have seen people who worked in horrible cement asbestos factories in India live upto 92 years of age and  at the same time saw people who did all the right things like eating Organic Food, reside in country side, do regular exercise die very young with freaking cancer or some other disease.  We can only control our destiny &amp; Life upto certain extent by doing following few textbook methods but in the end it ain't us who has control in the big picture.
Someone should have given Obama a good cup of Coffee before the debate. He looked dazed and lethargic!

It's confirmed, I am a goner. I would be 39 this October and my wife would be 33 in Feb, 2013. We are planning to have our first child now. We did not had a choice to do this earlier as we got married just two months ago.
The most important positive attribute of Imran Khan is his unflinching<br/>
belief in the Democratic ideals of Rule of Law and a Bureaucracy that<br/>
works without Prejudice to the masses it is supposed to work for.<br/>
Interview after Interview he gives reference points drawn from USA, UK<br/>
and other Western Countries about the importance of strong institutions<br/>
and checks and balances that stop any attempts at circumventing or<br/>
destroying those Institutional Values. <br/><br/>He is truely an enlightened and learned person. I wish someone like him<br/>
comes into Indian Politics and Civil Society.
This school will be closed and the founders arrested once the Sunnis come to power. The Problem is not with Islam, the problem is with the extremist Sunni interpretation of Islam and Islamic scriptures.  I have lived in Kuwait for about 5 years and closely observed the society, there is no such thing as a Women's Right or choice in these societies at all. It is a complete man's world and half of the society is nothing but a glorified slave. 
A heart wrenching story. Unending pain to the perp and families of the victims.<br/>
The moral of the story is that proper upbringing of the Children and inculcating<br/>
ethical and moral values in them would lead to a peaceful and kind society.<br/>
Especially the African American families need to get together and chalk out a plan<br/>
to avoid such untold misery to millions of their youth.<br/>
There needs to be a Revolution to Educate and be part of a productive civil society.
This country has lost its Soul! We are a morally bankrupt nation.
My Grand Mother was diagnosed with Leukemia or "Blood Cancer" as it is commonly known in India. I was with her for each and every Session of Chemo that she had to undergo. I can now fully identify with this article thanks to the conversations that I had with my Grand Mother. I was a teenager who was trying to motivate her by asking her to treat as a challenge and a battle. She would smile and not her head a few times. But after about the 11th or 12th Session , she said she has accepted the situation and has made peace with it. She will treat it as a an Act of Nature that is beyond her Control or in other words it was just meant to be. She endured great pain but maintained a certain dignity till the very end. I think that sums up the best way forward for all Cancer Patients.
College Education can be very affordable. The following are some points to consider:<br/>
1) Always prefer State Universities or County Colleges.<br/>
2) Stay with your parents instead of a dorm room and support them by working on Household Chores or bringing in some groceries from working in Small Odd Jobs over Weekends.<br/>
3) Make sure you work hard on Academics to be eligible for all kinds of Scholarships and other goodies.<br/>
4) Do not come into peer pressure with regard to having ipads, iphones and other things that you simply cannot afford.<br/>
5) Improve your Soft Skills including communication and presentation skills so that you can get through the Job Interviews right after the a college and start making some good money.
As I stated in my post, the Shock Value of Pollution is extreme for a person visiting from Western Hemisphere. As a person visiting from Bangalore you might experienced far more Pollution than Hyderabad. In-fact, for you Hyderabad would be a cleaner city than Bangalore. So, you wouldn't have noticed anything alarming at all. 
@MNA From Westchester,NY.... I have written in a very honest manner without any prejudice at all. I reiterate I was born there and have been going their regularly. Dengue , Chicken Gunya is extremely rampant from the last 6 years. Both are bone crushing diseases and could be fatal for a visitor from Western Hemisphere since their immunity is not accustomed to battling Tropical diseases. The Quality of Air has deteriorated a lot and the level of Carbon in Hyderabad is 3000% more than WHO standards. All i said was do research, to illustrate an Asthmatic patient or a person with weak Lungs would collapse within minutes after breathing air on Hyderabad Roads. The food looks colorful and spicy but people do not use glouses and kitchens are mostly open air kitchens. The residue from the polluted air settles on the food creating a very toxic edible element. I agree you have every reason to be agitated as an East Indian but I am just relaying my genuine perspective.
I was born and raised in this City for the first 26 years of my Life. I strongly caution Westerners against travelling to this city as it is extremely polluted, dusty and a chaotic city. The quality of air, water and food is extremely poor and people without an inbuilt immunity for third world elements would fall sick in a very short period of time. Also chicken gunuya and dengue are rampant between the months of May to October every year and there are no adequate hospitals to deal with menace. Please do your research before going to Hyderabad or India for that matter.
Would Americans feel better if our security agencies simply purchased (as opposed to collecting) such data from Facebook, Google, et al., like so many corporations already do (for non-National Security purposes)?<br/><br/>I value my privacy just as much as the next American...but I'd also like to remain alive whilst I'm enjoying it.
Things weve learned this week:<br/><br/>1)	That a newly elected Pope can be more rational, practical and commonsensical than a freshly elected Senator from Texas.
The Ted Cruz 'Show'.<br/><br/>Something tells me that this man will have all the time in the world to read Dr. Seuss to his daughter immediately following his next election cycle.
"Vote for Merkel Seen as Victory for Austerity": Unless you're on the receiving end of it.<br/><br/>Chancellor Merkel, a physical chemist by training, seems to take an overly deterministic lab-like tact towards governance: If I do this to that, then the calculations state that this should happen. Only, the world rarely works that way on the very messy macro-level of hour to hour human existence. 
'American made' matters to me if it means that some fellow American worker out there has earned a decent wage in the production of the item I am considering purchasing. However, my fear is that more and more companies will acquire technology (quite likely from foreign sources) to automate the American worker out of the process and, quite lawfully, slap an American Made sticker on the end product.<br/><br/>Very good article (plus graphics and photos). Well done.

Two things are guaranteed to happen hear: <br/><br/>A) People will complain.<br/>B) People will, yet again, submit.
As a person of color, I wonder if the lack of minorities in philosophy is not more due to the notion in many minority households that the opportunity to go to college is a means to a more utilitarian end (social mobility) and the pursuit of a degree in Philosophy...an impractical luxury.<br/><br/>This is not to diminish the importance of Philosophy, of course.
Professor Cowen seems to think that the hundreds-of-millions of "algorithmically displaced" human beings around the globe will simply shrug in acceptance of their fates and go off quietly into the night, never to be heard from again.<br/><br/>History (and human nature) teaches us exactly the opposite. What does he think the military will act at the behest of the lucky few? News for Prof. Cowen, the military is, by and large, manned by the sons, daughters, sisters and brothers, etc of those most vulnerable to being displaced by automation. Does he really think that they would "turn their bayonets" on their own loved ones because some soft-palmed politician has told them to do so?
The thing is there are places - entire countries - around the globe that are virtually free of any functioning form of government; Mali and Somalia come to mind...maybe Egypt in a couple more weeks.<br/>Why, then, can't these anti-government types simply relocate instead of attempting to  remake the United States into one of the government free "paradises" listed above? <br/><br/>Do send posts cards, and let us know how you like your new lives of "freedom" from the tyranny of Law and Order, Infrastructure, a medical system...civilization...etc. 
<br/>So far, all we've heard about is what an agent with access to this capability "could possibly look at" before he or she is stopped by system audits.<br/><br/>Thus far, the ONLY person with access to the system who has abused that access is SNOWDEN HIMSELF.<br/><br/>Otherwise, someone please direct me to the documents (or any other evidence) Snowden has published which provide PROOF of his claims of abuse or misuse.<br/><br/>waiting...

A) Did he accept any money from the Guardian for his "scoop"?<br/><br/>B) Does he believe that China, to which he has fled, provides greater civil liberties and respect for the privacy of its citizens (electronic, or otherwise) than the United States?
What methods would YOU employ in an effort  to detect and prevent terrorists attacks BEFORE they are successfully executed against Americans? What would YOU  be "okay with."?<br/><br/>Waiting...
"In 2012, 11,098 people were killed by terrorism globally, according to a new report by the U.S. State Department. TEN were Americans" ~The Wall Street Journal<br/><br/>There's a reason for this relatively low rate of American deaths at the hands of terrorists, and it's not just dumb luck.<br/><br/>We (and our data) no longer live in the 1700s; the world has changed. Evolve with it, or fall prey to it.
Nice job blogging. <br/><br/>I'm at work, so your updates are greatly appreciated. Mike Smith, huh? You can NEVER count that guy out.<br/><br/>Interrogative; who trains Palace Malice? If it's Nick Zito I might feel compelled to punch myself in the face for missing yet another Zito Belmont bomb.  Thanks again. 
First, Mrs. Obama puts a heckler in check, and then President Obama puts John McCain and Lindsey Graham in checkif not cardiac arrest.<br/><br/>A good day for America. A good day, indeed.
That portion of the country you're referring to became "alienated" the night Mr. Obama won the 2008 Presidential Election...AFTER having been born black. Any hopes for "bi-partisan efforts" (i.e. Republican-ese for "Give me EVERYTHING I demand, or no deals") between Democrats and Republicans was lost at that point as well...even before Mr. Obama had executed a single one of his policies.<br/><br/>You're right, she is fully qualified and she probably will do a great job. That should be enough. As for the politics of it, there is no possible gain and nothing further to lose when you're talking about the current iteration of the once sane Republican Party.
I am a progressive minded Democrat who grew up in Democrat supporting household. I am also a person of color whose life, to this date, has included a fair amount of success.<br/><br/>I am still waiting for the likes of E.W. Jackson, Herman Cain, and Dr. Ben Carson to explain to me, in detail, precisely how the Democratic Party has held me back or otherwise harmed me. <br/><br/>Additionally, I would like these men to detail exactly how they have come to the conclusion that the Republican Party (or Conservatism) is responsible for the successes theyve achieved in their lives.
The "creep factor" aside, Weiner's fatal flaw is that he is a proven security risk.<br/><br/> Here, this man was closest to a highly trusted assistant  (The lovely Huma) to the then Secretary of the United States, yet he does not recognize the risk in sending highly compromising personal "information" to strangers over the internet.<br/><br/>That time it was, among others, a twenty-something year old coed from Texas. Next time it'll be a fifty-something year old highly seasoned Chinese operative posing as a twenty-something year old coed from Texas.
I've witnessed the same at several companies I've worked at. <br/><br/>CEOs receiving accolades for demonstrating not one iota of business talent or acumen . Instead of demonstrating their value by actually increasing market share, they merely consolidate stagnate (or falling) profits at the top by CUTTING everywhere else.<br/><br/>As the saying goes... "A monkey can do that"...and for a LOT LESS money.
I usually stop reading at "McCain says...".
That "calculus" should include a NATO orchestrated and executed takeover of "western Syria" from the southern border of Turkey (a NATO member) to the Euphrates, along with a no-fly zone.<br/><br/>This would provide a means of alleviating the growing burden of Syrian refugees on neighboring countries, as well as providing a place of refuge for those Syrians who do not wish to live under the Assad regime. <br/><br/>In any case, Assad and his executors must still be held accountable by global powers, as their bloody methods must not be rewarded with some peace deal which allows them to remain in power in "eastern Syria". <br/><br/>They've gone too far.
He could point out that Mr. Bush  along with the rest of The gang who couldnt invade straight  is the only living human being who can say that his actions directly resulted in the birth of a new global state.<br/><br/>The new state of WEST IRANonly courteously still referred to as Iraq. 
The excuses made for this behavior are astounding.  The actions of the NSA, in collecting information on American citizens, are those of a totalitarian state.  Period.  What is so hard to understand about this concept?  
This is very courageous on both sides.  While a critical appraisal of the process is welcome, I hope the naysayers, doomsayers, and Republicans will refrain from undermining President Obama and Secretary Kerry in what is undoubtedly a delicate process.  
As a non-Catholic, Pope Francis is a breath of fresh air, and I appreciate Frank Bruni's commentary on the Church.  
For a few years now I have taken my search online to look for selected American-made textiles.  I have found jeans made in the US by two companies, with prices only $10 higher than the comparable Levis.  Sure, that's a 25% premium, but it's only $10, and I'm willing to pay that.  Another retailer sells its American-made jeans at a 100% premium, which is insane and calls into question its overall pricing.  As noted in this article, American-made sweatshirts are also reasonably priced, and I've seen knit shirts at reasonable prices, though limited in style and color.  However, but shirts at a reasonable price are a challenge.  American-made woven shirts - dress and casual - start at over $100, and that's just too much of a premium to pay, especially where imported shirts are available at discounters sometimes for under $20. 
My goodness.  Diplomacy.  Who'd a thunk it?<br/><br/>Ain't the modern age wonderful, though?  Everyone's either a foreign policy expert or a foreign policy critic.  Meanwhile, the real diplomats sweat the details and make it all happen.  All without firing a shot.  This is how it should work.  Republicans take note.
Reports over the last few years have noted zero tolerance drug and weapons policies in schools.   Granted, some schools have gone too far, e.g., the student who was punished for chewing a pop tart into the shape of a gun, and there probably be some moderation in applying these rules.  Nevertheless, these rules are in place.  Why is it that schools can't apply the same principle to bullying, whether physical or cyber?  
If the NSA were directing its efforts exclusively against foreign targets, then I would be at the head of the cheering section.  But this article and other recent revelations have documented that this is not the case.  Indeed, if a foreign country were directing its efforts against American citizens in the United States, we would consider it an egregious violation and take action against the perpetrators.  Unfortunately, it seems more accurate to say that the NSA has declared war against American citizens.
It becomes clear now why President Obama chose to support or take any action against the previous administration for its lies that drove the country into a ten-year morass in Iraq and Afghanistan.  To have done so would put him in the same position as Bush &amp; Co. with respect to his successor in 2012/2016.  <br/><br/>I am one of the 90% of Americans who have little faith in Congress to "do the right thing."  However, until recently I would have had far more confidence in President Obama doing the right thing.  If polled today, though, this yellow dog Democrat would be among those rating the president pretty low on the "do the right thing" scale with respect to Syria.
When I read stories such as these, I often wonder whether similar situations occur outside the U.S.  In this particular case, are the POCBS unique to the U.S., and do they represent some sort of fault in our infrastructure.  After all, given your collection of POCBS data, you have to wonder whether actions can, or should, be taken to protect against such outages.  At the same time, do similar outages occur in comparable numbers in other countries?
You just have to laugh at those who argue that Mr. Hopwood is likely to be unable to pass the character and fitness review required for admission to the Bar.  <br/><br/>If memory serves, lawyers in the Bush administration provided the justification for torture.  Character and fitness?  Try war crimes and crimes against humanity.<br/><br/>Lawyers were undoubtedly behind the subprime mortgage fiasco and the economic collapse in 2008.  Character and fitness?  Maybe a tad questionable, don't you think?
Let's give Secretary Kerry the benefit of the doubt and assume that all he said was true, and worthy of all the adjectival descriptions.<br/><br/>It does not in any way justify US intervention of any kind other than under the genuine auspices of the United Nations, i.e., no coalition of the willing or some such idiotic cover for US military intervention.  
I think it's long past time that Members of Congress deal with the realities that other branches of the government have to address daily and that all Americans have to confront in terms of health care costs and more.<br/><br/>Perhaps when Congress cuts its own perks, it will see its rating by its constituents rise above the single digits.<br/><br/>Let's start with staff and travel reductions, the elimination of multiple recesses and vacation time, the elimination of pension and retirements benefits, and the requirement that Members of Congress purchase their health insurance privately
Boo Hoo.  Maybe it's time members of Congress had to contend with issues that confront their constituents daily.  Where should I buy insurance?  How?  How do I compare plans?  How do I pay for it?  What deductible?  Making the choice between going to the doctor or not because of the cost.  Sure, these piddling little details mean nothing to the millionaires in Congress.  But, overall, no sympathy here for the 9% approval rating Congress.
The Republican vote on this bill and the many comments here from their supporters lead to only one conclusion.  Republicans are savages.  A government without demonstrable compassion for the neediest among their people is not a government I want to lead my nation.  Their behavior is despicable.  What is astounding is that votes such as these will not compel many Republican voters to consider voting D in the next election. And as long as we have this mostly 50/50 split, there is no way any of this will change.  
Secret courts.  Secret rulings.   Secret Lists.<br/><br/>These are things we condemned the Soviet Union and its satellite states for during the Cold Ware. Sure, the world has changed, blah, blah, blah.  Terror!  Fear!  There have to be limits.<br/><br/>How's this for a thought experiment?  To those who have posted here, or who are active on political forums, do you think twice before you post views in opposition to USG policies?
There have been distinctions between coach, business class, and first class for decades.  That's nothing new.  The larger problem, however, is that first is getting firstier, and coach is getting coachier, and these gaps are now everywhere, in the air and on the ground, and there's no longer the mobility or realistic aspirations to make our way to the other side of the curtain.  
This is a surprise why?  Any casual student of history could have - and many did - predict this a decade ago.  Cut our losses now and leave.  
Wow.  From outrage a few weeks ago over NSA spying to what-do-you-expect today.  I think it's fair to say we are outraged out.  Where does it stop?<br/><br/>I don't want to get all tinfoil hatty here, but consider for a minute that all metadata coverage allows the government to identify the social and business networks of every single American.  The so-called war on terror aside, commentators in recent weeks have observed that this information can allow the government, or private individuals/companies who obtain this information (legitimately or not), to manipulate markets, among other nefarious acts.<br/><br/>How does all of this differ from what the Communist regimes during the Cold War did, or tried their best to do?  We condemned those governments, and rightfully so, for violating human rights, repressing democratic movements, and the like.  
Putting aside the substance of the surveillance issue, I really can't help but chuckle at the indignation of the Republicans in Congress who filed the supporting brief.  You know full well that if a Republican was in the White House there would be no such outrage on the right.
Fascinating story.  
This should be front and center on the front page of the website and in print.<br/><br/>Further, the issue isn't only with 20- and 30-something "working class" folks, whatever "working class" means these days.  Graduates, too, regardless of "class," are suffering as well.  It's a buyer's market for workers, and this is reflected in pay and in how employees are treated.  They are interchangeable, replaceable at a moment's notice.  There is no loyalty, in either direction.  Federal and state governments used to offer opportunities, but these are either non-existent or dedicated almost exclusively to veterans.  For those who get jobs, there is no long-term stability, and so there is constant uncertainty that is going to have deleterious long-term consequences economically and socially in the coming generation.
What planet are you living on?<br/><br/>Let's put to rest the notion of paid internships.  Most internships out there are unpaid.  I learned recently of one where the "employer" (and, yes, the word is very deliberately in quotes) suggests that the intern have set aside more than $15,000 for living expenses during the internship.  Internships are yet another barrier setting apart the haves from the have nots.  It's nothing more than slave labor.  Period.<br/><br/>This may be hard to believe, but not everyone wants to be an entrepreneur.  And those who may have this notion don't have the funds to start.  I'll be that most people are silly enough to, get this, want a job.  A job that allows them to live, eat, pay student loans, and maybe, just maybe, begin to put aside some money for this thing they heard of once, retirement.  They don't want to run a company, discover the next big thing, or try raise millions in venture capital.  They don't want to reinvent themselves.  They want a fair wage, a place to stay, food, and maybe a pet.<br/><br/>With upwards of 5 million people unemployed, and almost certainly even more underemployed, 175,000 jobs a month isn't going to cut it.  And these two figures demonstrate why the slave labor option is possible.  But it is no less contemptible.
I'll bet a dollar to a donut that all those admiring Mr. Comey for his integrity are dyed in the wool Republicans.  <br/><br/>Sure, this may be a political move, or a tit for tat move to assure Republican approval, but if we've learned anything over the past 4+ years, Mr. Obama's moves toward bipartisanship have gained him nothing from Republicans and increasing discomfort from Democrats.   And you know full well that if/when a Republican becomes president, all Democrats will be removed from office post haste.  If Mr. Obama is playing 4-dimensional chess, it's one hell of a multi-dimensional, long-term play.
This is all well and good, but what about the folks who used to live in these homes and were foreclosed on?  Given the fact that the banks had no plans to do anything with these homes once they foreclosed, wouldn't it have made more sense to just restructure the mortgages?  Forget bailouts.  Forget hamp and tarp and any other acronymic programs.  Really, it's just common sense, which appears to be lacking in our financial system.  The banks didn't want to own these properties.  They had plan for them.  It wasn't as if they were going to resell them or raze them for some other economic development purpose. What's remarkable is that those who defaulted on their mortgages were portrayed as deadbeats and idiots, while the banks, which now own thousands of properties they fundamentally have no interest in, somehow walk away without even a second thought of the havoc they wrought.
The map is there. See the graphic above the link to the photo essay.
I'd be fine with the NSA collecting my information if they were honest about doing it. How can anyone trust those who lie to Congress? 
There's nothing wrong with looking at call logs if they get a court warrant first (a real warrant, not from the FISC). I doubt they would include that part in TV shows since it's rather boring. 
I'm curious as to why Lavabit didn't want to hand over Snowden's data. Is it because they don't accept the validity of FISA warrants or NSL's , or because they don't think what Snowden did was a crime? The implications of each are quite different. 
"If they search through my email, they will see that I have no intention of harming anyone."<br/><br/>Are you sure they're just checking to see if you're going to "harm anyone?" How easy would it be for them to use these searches against political dissidents? 
Funny, I remember signing up for accounts with Facebook and Amazon, but not with the NSA. 
The government has always been able to get a warrant from a court (a real, public court) to spy on people suspected of wrongdoing. That system was perfectly adequate. If blanket surveillance is so much better, why didn't it stop the Boston bombings? <br/><br/>The choice we have isn't between letting the government spy on everyone or doing nothing at all about terrorism. We had an effective  not to mention constitutional  system in place before this. 
How does this ruling NOT eviscerate a free press? As you said, cases set up a rule for ALL cases following thereafter. <br/><br/>If reporters refuse to testify against their sources they will most definitely not be "free," they will be put in jail. On the other hand if they do testify against their sources people will stop giving them valuable information, in which case they will not be "free" to report on the subjects they might want to. Most of the press is already nothing more than "infotainment." The last thing we need is for the few journalists who want to report real news losing their power to do so. <br/><br/>Reporter's privilege has been the default up until now and the sky has not fallen because of it. There is also attorneyclient privilege, so this would hardly be the first time someone who knew about a crime was not permitted to report it. I agree there must be a balance and that's exactly why these rules were invented.<br/><br/>I
"What would you say, then?"<br/><br/>I would say it's an unfortunate situation, but it can't be helped. It is more important to preserve a free press than to put one particular criminal in jail. 
A little logic can show how massive surveillance doesn't keep anyone safe.<br/><br/>It goes without saying that the smart terrorists use code words when they communicate. If one person e-mails another saying "my petunias are almost blooming," how do you know whether the word "petunia" is code for "bomb" or whether they're actually talking about flowers? You don't  unless you *already* have knowledge that some terrorists use "petunia" as a code word. To get that knowledge, you need to have had prior contact with a known terrorist organization. And if you already have that contact, you don't need to spy on everyone, only the people who are also contacting that organization. <br/><br/>Funny thing is, the government has *always* had the right to spy on known terrorist organizations, even without a warrant.
This is the real problem here; if you don't care about online privacy, you should at least care about the existence of secret courts and bodies of law. These are the tools of authoritarian regimes. Don't be fooled into thinking that just because we hold elections means we will always have a free country. Elected officials can be can be transformed into powerless figureheads just like kings and queens have been.
Companies do not want to "invest in the health and wellness of their team." Unemployment is high enough that they can afford to keep using employees up, spitting them out and hiring new ones. Conditions will not improve for workers until that changes. 
You raise a very good point. It seems that people these days are either overworked or unemployed, with no middle ground. If this trend continues (and our social welfare systems hold up) we will eventually reach the point where half the continent is working so that the other half doesn't have to.<br/><br/>I think the solution is to equally divide up not money but labor. In other words, set a maximum workweek  and put enough enforcement in place to make sure companies stick to it. This would reduce both unemployment and the health problems caused by overworking.
Well of course they want to criminalize journalism. It is the nature of governments to always want more power than they currently have. 
The problem isn't technology, it's the law. When the corporation was first invented, our government saw the limitless power such entities could potentially attain, and so it instituted many laws to govern how corporations operate. Unfortunately some of those laws never worked as expected, and the ones that did work have been eroded over time by lobbyists with money. To fix the wealth imbalance in our society, all we need to do is fix those corporate regulations that are not working. Wealth distribution would happen automatically instead of inefficiently through some kind of government program. <br/><br/>We have forgotten that the corporation is not an indelible entity. It is an artifice that we invented, and we have the power to change how it functions.
I doubt that the 12 million pounds is legally enforceable, but otherwise this agreement makes sense. Wikileaks' very survival depends on being secretive.  They certainly can't be held to the same standards of transparency as a government or even a large corporation. <br/><br/>The idea of selling information to publishers is nothing to complain about either.  Nonprofit organizations often charge fees for their services. For example, even though your local Humane Society is a registered charity, you still have to pay money to adopt a pet from it.
Seriously, why would this surprise anyone? Did anyone really think the NSA intercepts telephone and internet communications just for the sake of doing it?
Which one (artwork I mean)?
Are you two kidding me? Who sold/gave the the weapons that are being used to k|ll Americans In Afghanistan? Let me guess, the Chinese?

'That was a lie'.<br/>To anyone who has disagreed with me when I said I didn't believe it, there it is! Imagine what else we don't know. Time to evaluate your naivety.
Well said. However your use of 'tribal' instead of 'ethnic' is distracting.
Smart move by China. When U.S.'s Harvard educated president talks about investment in human capital it's labeled what, 'socialist spending'? Watch and learn America. Watch and learn.

'Even by your standards' tells me the doctor_patient relationship is open, close and free. The fact that he said it to this patient doesn't mean he would say the same to another patient who sees him with the same issue.
Please! My whole life I have never seen a mango peeled. Wash it with dish detergent and dish sponge and then rinse it (just like you would a cup). The skin is very nutritious.<br/><br/>Now lets talk about potatoes with skin. Ugh! People actually pay for potato skins.
Aah, it happened in that kingdom with an evil king therefore it is 'Stunt Deriding Putin'. If it happened in the U.S. it'd be called public nuisance, offense against public order, disruption or disturbance of a religious service...
Thank you China. Make it a level playing ground. Once exposed to CCTV, CNC World, Russia Today, Al Jazeera, BBC, Voice of America... Africans can decide for themselves who is 'good' and who is 'bad'. They don't need a self-aggrandizing baby sitter with an agenda.
So, what does Kenya think about their achievements or lack there of? Yea, Africans are in the Olympics too.
It was just a matter of time. All it takes is an American loss for the word 'doping' to start being thrown around - and the Chinese dared to be the winners this time around. I didn't see this much suspicion when Phelps was winning.
'..the demise of its football program.'<br/><br/>Absolutely disagree. Learn from this experience. Don't punish the kids for the sins committed by their fathers.
Wish I was there zezee. I really do. After the game, ESPN should have taken us there. But of course I'm aware ESPN is just talk TV.

I disagree with your assessment of Balotelli's performance. He did not play this game any differently than he did against Germany. The way I saw it, the Spaniards just wouldn't let him do anything with the ball. They are that good.
I agree Rookie and I've watched quite a few. Posters keep bringing up Pele's Brazil (no wonder someone asked you how old you are). Fact: Pele's Brazil could not beat today's Spain. It's not even fair to compare them because they played very different games in different football eras.
In this sport, excellence is not measured by the number of years. It's what you've DONE in those four years.
I gasped when I saw the 719 and 562. Holy moly is correct. I can't wait to watch this event.
It never really was.
