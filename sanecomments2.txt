Slow cookers are great in the summer, because that doesn't heat up your kitchen as much as the oven or boiling something on the stove!  I like your point about focusing on the bigger picture too.
I'm glad some readers found the suggestion helpful :)  I also love Mark Bittman's How to Cook Everything!  It's an excellent resource for learning many ways to prepare each kind of food.
Whenever somebody who is new to cooking and meal planning asks me how it's done on a time and cost budget, I always recommend the book, Cheap. Fast. Good! by Beverly Mills and Alicia Ross as a place to start.  It's pretty average food and the recipes tend to be quick and inexpensive and possible for a novice cook.  Somebody with a particular diet or desire for a high dining kind of meal isn't going to like these recipes.  As far as the relative "healthiness" of the meals, sometimes that could be debated.  But for the practicality of just trying to get something basic and acceptable on the table throughout the week, it's a very useful resource.  I still make some of the recipes often, though I've had my copy since 2005!  Beyond recipes, what I think is helpful about this book is the explanation of the strategies of meal planning, shopping, food preparation schedules, how to use the same already prepped ingredients in multiple meals and how to substitute ingredients.<br/><br/>My spouse and I tend to do shopping and a kitchen shift on Sundays to get everything made for lunches through the week and have the ingredients on hand and meals planned for the week.  We tend to plan dinners so we have enough for two nights from each meal, so we cook and clean up only every other day.  We both enjoy cooking separately and together, so the cooking is a fun activity in addition to all the work it takes to eat mostly home made food most of the time.
Another side to this is the need to encourage all fathers to find it "normal" to take care of their kids and do the things you were doing, because frankly many of them don't find this normal.  I agree that the stereotype exists and it's unfair when applied to fathers like you, and can become a self fulfilling prophecy.  But it is based on a strong historical precedent and is still the reality in many families.<br/><br/>Some less involved dads feel awkward and unsure about childcare and quickly give up when it doesn't seem to go as easily as what they see others doing.  Perhaps some fathers would be encouraged to have a more realistic perspective and continue trying if people praised their efforts.
But did your high school work experience help you get better work study positions in college?  Not sure of when you were in college, but I know many current and recent college students who are finding that desirable or even undesirable campus jobs are not a given.  Everyone even at that level would like to see some work experience.
"the best education she possibly can" get may be a lofty goal in light of a simple love of education, but it is NOT a given path to success in employment or adult maturity and self-sufficiency.  Wasn't this misconception (or deception depending on who you're talking to) a major part of the Occupy movement?  All these best educated people who couldn't get a useful job.  Was it because they had no work skills?  Was it because they had inadequate perspective and discernment when choosing a major in college, because they had no experience with anything as teens?
Of the high school extra curriculars I was a part of, I would say my part time job had the most long lasting positive impact on my life.  Basic work skills, like arriving on time, following directions from a boss, dealing with a rude boss, a difficult coworker, or mean customers are all important skills that I see many of my peers now lacking.  It also put me in a peer situation with working class people, which was so very valuable in giving me some perspective beyond my middle class intellectual cohort.  That high school job taught a lot of humility.  There are a lot of things you can tell your kids that they may understand on an academic level, but they won't really "get" it until they've lived it.<br/><br/>It's true that it was a challenge in balancing for me, also a top student.  My parents allowed me to decide what to do.  When I felt like I had too much on my plate, I chose to keep working over some other extracurriculars.  I earned enough scholarships to cover my complete tuition and part of room and board at my state school for undergrad.  I also have a master's degree from the top program in America for my profession.  I also was able to get a professional job related to my degree living in one of the most unemployed cities in America several months after the housing crash.  Considering those accomplishments, it would be hard to say I was harmed by working a little instead of playing soccer etc in high school.
As others have written, I think it's perfectly logical for her to be confused and upset in a scenario where you've told her you can't all be together anymore because the parents aren't happy together, but then spend intentional time together in which the parents appear to be happy together.  She's too little to understand what you mean by "not happy together" as an adult couple, and why being kind and pleasant with one another for a dinner is not the same as being happily married and living together as a family.  <br/><br/>What do you think it means to her if somebody is "not happy" with somebody else?  It could vary a lot based on her experiences.  Regardless, she has now learned that a family member can become "not happy" with another family member and separate.  She might be afraid this could happen to her if one or both parents becomes unhappy with her.  If mom and dad can stop being husband and wife and live apart, then why should she assume mom and daughter or dad and daughter can't do the same?  Obviously this would be a very upsetting fear.  Maybe M has been clearer with her daughter than what she wrote here, but if she hasn't she needs to be.<br/><br/>I don't understand the purpose of these dinners anyway.  It's certainly positive for the parents to be kind, pleasant, helpful, fair, etc with one another but a monthly dinner is not necessary to teach your daughter how to be this way.  She will learn by how you treat everyone and each other in everyday situations.
I think it is very wise to be thoughtful about how you talk about race and prejudice and stereotypes with children to help make sure what you say can be understood at their age and so on.  But you just can't leave it out.  Actually I think using these stories is a great way to introduce these discussions, because you can introduce these ideas in a safe environment where you can be calm and have the time and calmness to ask good questions and offer good explanations.<br/><br/>Whether or not you're telling your child what you believe is right and wrong about these things, other people will be sending messages.  Your child may even assume you agree with whatever he/she sees as "the way things are" through inadvertent and unexamined observations if you do not say otherwise and set a different example.<br/><br/>Think of this.  What if you and your son are at the store and you see a man mock a black customer who did something clumsy by imitating a gorilla, and your son thinks this is funny?  What if he laughs or says something out loud about how funny this is, whether or not he is laughing at the racism in it?  How are you going to address this in this setting, where other people are bound to be upset and looking to see what you will do?  If you had talked about the book, maybe your son would say "dad, I can't believe that man is really acting like a gorilla, it's so awful" or even, "hey mister, you can't treat people that way, it's not right."
I agree with this!
I think the reflections provided by these readers are excellent and spot on!
Wow!  Critical thinking about society's portrayal and expectations of women is so important, but I very firmly believe that these kind of  lessons do not apply to every girl's experience every time.  Without knowing the author's daughter, I cannot guess whether her reaction matched the context of her daughter's wishes or not.  Maybe she did want to wear makeup for all the reasons the author is trying to teach against... but maybe she didn't.  It's not always easy for kids to explain their motivations to an adult, especially when they perceive they are being negatively judged at the outset!<br/><br/>I wanted to start wearing makeup around age 12 and wasn't allowed for a few more years, told simply that I wasn't "old enough." Looking back, I can honestly say all I wanted was to be able to wear the shimmery pastel eye shadows!  I wanted this because I thought shimmery pastels were pretty in general, my friends were allowed and it seemed fun to be able to match the eye shadow to one's shirt and so on.  In the context of my perspective and my peers at that time, that's ALL it was.  I had no interest in being made up like a model or trying to emulate women in music videos and magazines, etc. and no interest in attracting sexual attention.   I have no idea how I would have responded if I had received lecture like the author gave her daughter, but I'm sure it wouldn't have been positive for my relationship with my parent or my understanding of feminism.
I know so many women who did not build a solid history of professional work while young, before or while raising children.  Now that the children are grown, many many many of those women would like to work in a professional capacity because they turned out to need the money and/or a purposeful way to spend time.  Even though they value their memories and experiences from being stay-at-home-moms, they also are unhappy about having to start from the beginning at age 45-55 in education and entry-level professional positions which tend to be lower paid and have more inconvenient job conditions than what is available to people with years of experience.  Many of those women do wish they had done something along a professional path when younger.  Maybe your SIL will never feel like she needs to or wants to work after her kids are grown up, but if she does she will probably have some of "regrets" of her own!
"We may inflict those judgments on one another, but were really judging ourselves. Every accusation is a self-defense, and every defense a self-justification  because no matter how we make our choices (or have life circumstances choose on our behalf) there is no perfect way to balance all of what we want when we want it. That is the biggest conflict of them all. To hang every choice of home over work on the pressure to mother in a certain way seems to me to be missing the pressures that would remain even in the absence of the natural parenting movement."<br/><br/>You said this so very excellently!
The most ridiculous thing I was told by a "pregnancy police" was that I should avoid taking a scenic walk on a vacation because I might "fall and hurt the baby."  This was not a high adventure high impact trail, it was newly paved, and even hardly had an incline!  I'm pretty sure I'm more likely to fall in my own home, trip on an uneven sidewalk, or slip in a spill at the grocery store.
Avoiding food poisoning is a worthwhile effort, pregnant or not.<br/><br/>The thing about food poisoning is I've only ever gotten it from cheeseburgers in restaurants, a few times.  Never from nice cheese, never from sushi, never from medium rare steak, never from soft boiled eggs, which I eat far far more often that cheeseburgers out.  And recent outbreaks show you never know when your spinach or cantaloupe or peanut butter etc could be contaminated.  (wait you're supposed to avoid pb now if you listen to the pregnancy police)  <br/><br/>There is no reason to expect the food supply to be different when you're pregnant.  I have never heard anyone tell pregnant women they can only eat foods they personally cooked themselves to a temperature of 180 degrees F.  Hopefully I am not giving anyone more ideas of things to add to the list...
I like many of the suggestions already offered here.  Here's another thing to try if your son doesn't seem to be able to realize he's dreaming within his dreams and direct the narratives.  You could encourage him to make up new endings after he wakes up.  For example in the monster-faced puddle dream, maybe he can find a giant fan beside him that dries up the water right away, or he realizes the monster face was just a reflection from a nearby movie poster, or it turned out there was a harmless little bug swimming in the puddle but the image was distorted by the surface of the water, etc.  If he likes to draw, he could even draw the new ending.  This could give him a way to feel as if he has closure from the bad dreams and more control over how he feels.  If he's able to describe his dreams in such detail at this age, I think he also would be able to imagine some pretty creative new endings!  
I agree about being careful about using words like mean or sick as an explanation of why she doesn't know this grandma, because a child may attach the consequence (estrangement) to all kinds of other ways of being mean or sick.  She may make this connection and not tell you because she is afraid of what could happen, especially if her mom is the one who gets called mean or becomes sick.<br/><br/>By the time she's old enough to ask questions about this, she should already have some understanding about who is a stranger, that strangers are dangerous and she needs to stay away from them.  You could frame your explanation about this grandma in a similar way.  "We don't see her because we can't trust her.  She might do something really bad to hurt us, like a stranger, so we stay away and we don't talk to her."  If you want to be more specific, I'm sure you could find some children's books that would offer some age appropriate concepts about abuse, maybe even at your library.
I think this is a very sad story because of the way the mother used shame in her efforts.  The mother tried to attach shame to weight for appearances and the child's behavior with food, even when it was pretty iffy to assume the child's behavior was inappropriate for her age.  And then she went further and even tried to attach those things to identity worth as a person overall!<br/><br/>However, I have a lot of hope for Bea because of her comment about being the same person as she was before the weight loss.  I think that's a profound thought for a child that age, let alone anyone of any age who struggles with identity and self worth relating to weight.  I think this is a sign she is rejecting her mother's perspective and that it shows a lot of independent thinking for her age... even if that independence is inspired by stubbornness and an urge to defy her mother at this point more than anything else.  (with a mother who behaves so randomly and hypocritically as that, this seems like a natural response!)  It's a good sign for her resilience. <br/><br/>I don't think Bea is necessarily on a path to lifelong dysfunction.  I know people who came from good and bad (self described) food and weight environments growing up, who have had varied outcomes as adults in terms of health or dysfunction when it comes to food, weight and self image.  There may be a correlation but the direction is not fully inevitable.  Everyone has to figure this out for him/herself as an adult regardless of background.
You don't have to make oatmeal hot.  You can use rolled oats (not instant) or steel cut oats and put them in milk in the fridge the night before.  For myself, I prefer 1/2 C rolled oats plus 1 C milk, plus1 C fruit and a small (like tsp small!) drizzle of honey across the top.  it's not crunchy but has sort of consistency of a bowl of cereal rather than the sticky thick oatmeal.  Steel cut oats are chewier.  This doesn't involve cooking, it just has to be put together the night before rather than poured in the morning.  Blueberries from frozen might be the most fun fruit for kids because they turn it purple!
You can make spaghetti sauce from tomato paste in almost as little time as heating up jar sauce once you know what seasonings and thickness you like.  This way you avoid the excess sugar and salt.  I only put a pinch of sugar in mine!
Allison, you can purchase plain yogurt and put your own fruit/ sweetener in.  If it's meant for lunch away from home, you can put it in small containers.  This way, you add less sugar and can put a whole serving of fruit in if you want.  Yes it is a little more effort, but it even tastes better and should cost you less on top of reducing the added sugar!
I'm surprised that so many people are recommending talking to the girlfriends' parents, as she is 18.  It would be different if she were a minor.  An 18-year-old may not be fully independent or "grown up" but 18 means she is independently responsible to choose or reject medical treatment and has a right to complete privacy of all medical information when it comes to her parents. As a "friendly neighbor" to this girl rather than a health professional, of course D is not bound to things like patient centered care and HIPPA.  But I think she should maintain the same ethic anyway, she should not tell the parents and she should not try to force the girlfriend into an intervention.<br/><br/>I think D can privately and calmly talk to the girlfriend if she wants to.  She should just tell the girlfriend that she has noticed the purging behavior going on for a while and is worried about her health.  If the girlfriend is willing to talk about what she's doing, listen and be kind and calm and mostly listen.  If she's not willing to talk about it, or she just wants to talk and doesn't want to take action, all you can do is let her know you care about her and are willing to help her access care if she decides she wants it.  If she wants you to help, great!  If not, just try to be kind to her over time anyway.  You can't "make" her see her problem and get care if she's not ready to do it.
Okay, this has converted me back to the camp that favors tipping. The campaign against leaving tips and including them in the price is a way of removing customer feedback. I do not like it if there is no salt available, even though I only occasionally add any extra. Even the best chefs make mistakes, and a more modest tip is the best way to cajole the staff to tell them to have salt available without the hassle of having to ask for it. 
It is interesting to read so many comments that roundly condemn the government under aliases (when there are any) that are so transparent that Radio Shack rejects could figure them out. Whatever else the NSA has done, it does not seem to have stifled dissent. 
Dismayed in Boston: The mortgage deduction by itself is not a distortion, as you correctly note. The distortion is, as Bruce points out, the absence of a tax on the net imputed rental value of homes. Because taxing imputed value is difficult (though the Swiss manage to do it), most economists (I am of that tribe) think that a second best method of correcting the distortion is to disallow the mortgage deduction. A deduction for first mortgages below a certain amount, say for starter homes, would encourage homeownership by those who need the help and still go a long way toward correcting overinvestment in housing. 
Bruce, I don't quite get this. If people did trade with their neighbors, they would have to be paid an explicit rent whose proceeds (net of interest, maintenance, and property taxes) would be taxable income. Where's the distortion? 
The simple alternative to taxing imputed rent is to disallow the mortgage deduction for homeowners. It isn't as economically elegant as taxing imputed rent (home equity would still be tax-favored), but it would reduce most of the disparities that inefficiently favor homeowners over renters. Allowing renters to deduct would make the capital market distortions worse. 
A fine essay. Professor Jackson's lifelong study of urban history offers an excellent perspective on the need to see New York as an evolving city in a world economy. A city preserved in amber, as the historic preservationists sometimes seem to desire, is inconsistent with New York's history. 
The NFL got off light because the players had such a poor case. The salaries they earned were large in part because football is a dangerous game, and everyone knows it. It's the same reason ironworkers who work on skyscrapers get more money than construction workers who stay on the ground. 
The no-nukes people will win; rational argument will not persuade them. The only realistic response to sea-level rise will be seawalls, stilts, and relocation. The example of the Netherlands demonstrates that you can invest a lot in that kind of infrastructure and still be a wealthy society. 
The depressing part of this article (and many of the comments) is how much it relies on sources whose source of income is a particular cause, like the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. What would you expect them to say? Oster is an economist, not a statistician, and economists tend to judge policies based on the overall well being of people, not just particular parts of them. Oster seems to be arguing that baby docs should pay attention to the mother's well being, too. 
The claim that taxpayers who do not itemize get no benefit from the charitable contribution deduction is doubtful. If the charitable deduction were eliminated, the standard deduction would probably be reduced. That said, those who use the standard deduction have no extra incentive to contribute to a charity. Maybe the standard deduction needs to be eliminated so everyone has an incentive to itemize and thus contribute to the charities of their choice. 
To depressionbaby: According to Wikipedia, Chicago's murder rate peaked in 1992 and has fallen since then, just like other big cities. Chicago's crime rate is still above New York's, so maybe one could credit stop and frisk for that (though the article said Chicago had adopted some NYC and LA techniques), but the general reduction in crime nationally cannot be attributed to stop and frisk. 
The claim by Mr. Otis that stop and frisk and long prison sentences cut crime is not convincing. Crime has dropped in nearly every big city, even those that have not adopted stop and frisk. Long sentences started in the 1970s, but crime kept going up until 1990. It is time to take more seriously the idea that crime has been reduced by the empowerment of ordinary people with cell phones and cameras, which started to become widespread in 1990. Potential criminals fear a person who can report or photograph them instantly almost as much as they fear a cop with a gun. Of course the phone and photo hypothesis is going to be dismissed by those who are invested in the criminal "justice" system, but if people recognized that the smart phone is more effective than the gun, Trayvon might still be alive. 
ACW reads Animal Farm in a strange way. The animals have accomplished a revolution and live in a socialist society. Old Boxer, the loyal party workhorse, is sold by the socialist leaders (pigs Snowball and Napoleon, thin disguises for Lenin and Stalin) to the slaughterhouse after he becomes useless. 
Nightwood means well, but a friend's father told his children that he might commit suicide a year before he did so, and it caused them endless anxiety and depression because they could not do anything about it. It might be more merciful to make an unannounced exit. 
Quarter of a billion for the Post? Considering that the Boston Globe sold for less than third of that, the Graham family and stockholders did not do too badly. Maybe the industry has bottomed out. 
If Brooke could have read this article before the accident, would he have chosen to live? (The hypothetical assumes he could not prevent the accident and could have stopped the nurse from reviving him in the moments after it.) I am guessing the answer would be no. His wife would have had an intense period of grief, then gotten over it and gone on with her life. And that's why he would have chosen to die, because he loves her. 
Well, at least this should remind us that obesity is not a uniquely American problem. Good luck to the mall walkers; something is always better than nothing. 
Statistical nonsense is not the same as plain old nonsense. Kahneman seems to tell us that if you get robbed in the same dark alley ten nights in a row, you should keep on going there because ten is not a statistically significant sample. I liked the book, too, but some things don't require quite that much testing. Dougr's point might be modified to say that aspirin's effect on cancer is an interesting possibility that is worth more study. 
Friedman undermines his sensible message with scare tactics. World population growth is slowing so that "ZPG" is possible in this century, and a world in which Chinese and Indians have an American standard of living is one in which the majority of its population will be willing to sacrifice something for a better environment. "Burn up the planet" phrases don't help the conversation. 
Great column, one of the most prescient comments on immigration and ethnic integration. Mutts we are, indeed. Fie on those who take offense at that vigorous term. America will lead the world with its disdain for ethnicity and eye on the future. A Fourth of July for the whole of humanity!
Sleep is good, but so are other things in life. The 8-hour optimum studies were experiments in which subjects had nothing to do when they were awake. Getting fired from your job because you slept in and missed a deadline is bad for your health, too. Forbidding an occasional late-night bout of homework can be similarly harmful to your children's life prospects. Lab studies are great, but they need a few reality checks before they get translated into recommendations for ordinary people. 
People seem to assume that talking on the phone is the same as talking with a passenger in the car. The big difference is that the passenger can help spot potential hazards--child in a crosswalk, a veering bicycle--while the person on the other end of the phone cannot. Back-seat driving helps offset the passenger distractions, but invisible correspondents cannot. 
We need to ask why the Fourth Amendment exists. It clearly contemplates that some guilty parties will not be apprehended. One reason for enduring this cost is to avoid abuse of power. The cops and their bosses are limited because they possess the awesome power of arrest and detainment, something the rest of us do not have and must submit to. So the Fourth limits the scope of what police can do, even if it allows some criminals to remain free. It helps us stay free of the police state, and this decision seems to reduce that protection. 
Niel, would you really rather not have known this? 
Mick, this may be the first time I have ever laughed right out loud while reading the New York Times.
Exactly.  The false idea that gluten-free food must be expensive seems to be rooted in the fact that gluten-free *processed* food is expensive.  But if you are facing a significant health challenge, you should probably be avoiding processed foods anyway.  Whole foods provide much better nutrition, nutrition which can help to normalize biological feedback loops.<br/><br/>Vegetables are gluten-free and generally inexpensive.  So are beans, and potatoes, and rice, and fruits.  <br/><br/>As I posted on an earlier article in this series, several years of testing various possibilities-- multiple times each--showed me that I am healthy when I avoid all gluten, all dairy, and eggs.  But when I eat even small amounts of these substances, I have a major autoimmune flare.  <br/><br/>Diet may not help all people with autoimmune disease, but it makes a real difference for others.  It's worth experimenting to see which camp you fall into.
I don't specifically have RA, but I do have "undifferentiated autoimmune disease" and my anti-nuclear antibodies have regularly been 1280 or higher.  I've also had significant extended problems with exhaustion and pain.  <br/><br/>Two things that have really helped me feel radically better: 1) Low-dose naltrexone, as mentioned in one of the questions here.  It has no bad side-effects; it's really cheap (especially if you make your own from 50 mg tablets--look on the web to find out how to do this; it's easy); and many people, including me, find that it greatly improves quality of life. <br/><br/>2) Food elimination diet.  Either follow the protocol that you can find on the internet for eliminating the eight most common problem food groups, or simply experiment with eliminating the foods that you suspect are a problem for you.  In my case, I get horribly sick for about a week if I eat wheat/gluten, dairy of any sort (milk, butter, cheese, cream), and/or eggs.  When I don't eat these foods, I feel good.<br/><br/>I mention these tips in the hope that they will be of use to someone else.  Much of my health improvement came about by following leads I found on the internet.
I just saw this story, so I hope my comment isn't too late.  If you're in Kansas City, I highly recommend the Jazz and Blues Museum, and the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum, which are right next to one another.  I don't even like baseball, but the Negro Leagues Museum was fascinating.  Then take yourself off to Arthur Bryant's Barbeque, which is right nearby.  It's not glamorous by a long shot, but the food is good and a visit there counts as a distinctive Kansas City experience.
If you re-read the piece, you'll see that the patient was "treated for 10 years" only with attention to her surface symptoms (sinus infections, etc.), and not (as far as we can tell from the essay) with attention to locating an underlying etiology that was producing those surface symptoms.  Finally the author of the piece determined, apparently, that the underlying etiology was psychosomatic.  That is what many of us are criticizing, because many of us have had hard-to-diagnose diseases dismissed as psychosomatic.  Being "treated for 10 years" is not at all the same thing as "being treated with an eye to figuring out what is really biologically wrong with the patient."
Thank you for your comment, Mary.  I had the same concern about this article.  After ten years of chronic illness that doctors told me was all in my head, I have finally been diagnosed with an autoimmune illness.  Doctors kept prescribing me Prozac (which I did not take, as I knew I had a biological problem).  It was a very, very hard slog to find a doctor who would actually look hard to figure out the nature of my problem, rather that assuming that *I* was the problem.<br/><br/>I can certainly understand that it is frustrating for a doctor who cannot figure out the cause of the patient's physical suffering.  But in my experience, doctors do not need any encouragement whatsoever to move to the conclusion that unexplained health problems are psychological in origin.
I agree with you that more than punishment is needed, and that prevention training would be very helpful.  But I disagree that "people who act out sexually have deep complex psychological problems."  That view makes the problem of sexual assault solely a matter of the individual's imbalance.  The reason why the sexual assault rate is so high in the military right now is not because there's such a high proportion of loonies in uniform, but because the culture of the military is currently a "rape culture."  Changing the culture is a major part of the battle, which is why prevention and educational initiatives would be very helpful.  But improving punishment structures is also very important, because it signals that the culture of sexual assault is no longer acceptable.
This is a great story.  Thanks for sharing it.  One thing you might want to be aware of, though: "the short hairs" is generally considered to be a euphemism for "pubic hair."  (A quick internet search confirms that this is in fact the standard definition.)  You might not have wanted to indicate that this was where/how your mother grabbed you.
The honor code at the college where I am a professor explicitly forbids handing in the same assignment to two different classes.  Consequently, doing so is cheating.
But when commanders overturn the verdicts of soldiers who are guilty of sexual assault, there is no good reason.  And it should not be allowed.
Store shopping is a pain.  I prefer buying online.  And I am female.
I have thyroid problems too, and something that has been very helpful to me is the Stop The Thyroid Madness website.  For many people, Synthroid does not help to restore full health.  Our bodies process thyroid hormones differently (medicine has yet to catch up on this point), meaning that we do not efficiently convert T4 to T3, and thus lack energy, motivation, mental clarity, etc. while taking T4 meds.  For anyone taking Synthroid but not experiencing robust good health, I recommend reading through the website and then taking your health into your own hands.  I did, and it has made an enormous positive difference for me.
I've read that eating tart cherriesdaily  (or drinking the juice) will alleviate (or at least mitigate) gout.  Apparently this is a folk remedy that actually works.
You report that this study shows that "people" with a higher resting heart rate will die earlier than those with a lower rate.  Yet the study relied exclusively on male subjects.  What are the implications for heart rate and mortality in women?  We don't know, because men's and women's bodies do not always behave in the same ways, and do not always have the same markers of good health and bad health (e.g., differing signs of impending and of actual heart attacks).  <br/><br/>It is a persistent problem in medicine and science that studies purporting to demonstrate results for "people" are performed only on men.  Please don't support that trend with factually incorrect journalism.  This study shows nothing about "people"; its results apply, as demonstrated, to males.
My blender container--a Vitamix--can't be disassembled for cleaning.  There must be rubber seals at the bottom to prevent the container from leaking.  I do wash it with warm to hot soapy water after each use, and then turn it upside down to air dry.  Am I likely to have the same problems discussed in this article?  If so, is there anything I can do short of dousing the blender with bleach?  
My understanding is that line cooks are paid a living hourly wage, while servers are not: the hourly wage for servers is far below the minimum wage.  Servers do work primarily for tips, while others in the restaurant do not.
What I really long for is a healthy fast-food restaurant with a drive-through window.  Sometimes I'm just in a hurry, or too tired to get out of my car . . . but I still don't want to eat junk.  
To Anne: Actually, making your own is quite inexpensive and can be very reliable.  Read Sandor Katz's blog online--he will tell you exactly how to do it.  I have never once had a failure, and I don't use any fancy equipment.  It's a great way to protect and upgrade your intestinal flora.
The girl may very well struggle with the trauma for the rest of her life.  Even though she was "physically unharmed," she may have PTSD.  You are wrong to underplay the long-term effects of being raped by multiple people, urinated on, treated as a non-human plaything, and treated as the source of all the trouble by many, many people in her community.<br/><br/>Yes, the perpetrators are technically not adults.  But they are only a year or two away.  They should have known better than to treat another human being like a thing.  <br/><br/>You do not have the platform to offer the perpetrators forgiveness.  Only the victim does.
Some testimony given elsewhere has suggested that the girl was given rohypnol, which if true, would account for her being completely passed out for a long time, and for her having passed out despite not having had a great deal to drink.  <br/><br/>Was this factor not raised at all at the trial, and if so, why not?
as a history and philosophy teacher - I find the division between lineral and conservative to be questionable. But people who were raised in protistant enviornments, especially very religious ones are almost impossible to teach and I recommend they go to the social sciences or the hard sciences where there is more obvious methodology.  I cannot fight a student who rejects a philosophical system because it calls into question their personal beliefs.  Liberals are also inclinded to reject, but given the choise, they at least give the idea a chance - and thats all I need to work with.<br /><br />So its not bias on the part of the institution or subject - its the bias of the student that starts the ball rolling.
While running for president in 2008, John McCain visited Jordan and Israel and had to be reminded several times by his running mate why the Shia leaders of Iran would not dream of training the Sunni extremists who led  al-qaeda in Iraq. For his part Lindsay Graham is now taking heat from a younger female rival within his own party in South Carolina whose campaign strategy hinges on mocking him for being effeminate. Squirrely as ever, Rand Paul now looks to be the short-term winner of all this chaos.  He's that fellow who is wrong about pretty much everything--except whether or not Obama should have called a coup a coup as soon as it happened. Needless to say, the Republican Party remains utterly dysfunctional.<br/><br/>John Kerry has been a disappointment at State, and Chuck Hagel appears to have made the same blunder Dubya made when he said he had looked into Putin's eyes and declared that he saw a man whom he could trust. I regret that the Egyptian army is bankrolled by American tax dollars, but the one thing that is most certain in my mind is that I don't want my son sent off to fight in a war in the Middle East. The Saudis and Israelis can send their sons to fight in Egypt if they want to, but they need to know that my son and his friends are going to remain at home on this side of the planet.  After all, nobody in Egypt ever referred to them as the other 47%.<br/><br/>This is an excellent but heartbreaking article. Thermidor.  Revolutions devour their own.
The party of Lincoln is dying. Conserving and destroying are different things. As a child I was inspired by Lamar Alexander's walk across Tennessee when he ran for governor. He connected with ordinary people. In more recent years, Alexander has helped save Tennessee's mountains. That's my idea of conservatism. Taking care of things. Respecting your elders. Leaving something for the next generation to cherish.
Praising Bill Gates has grown into a cottage industry.
I can think of some troubling stories that involve the use of machines in the history of  psychology (from shock therapy to lie detectors).  Have their been comparable success stories to offset these accounts?<br/><br/>I understand the appeal of such a machine.  Mental disorders are a well know route toward receiving payments ffrom Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), and that's especially true for children, with ADHD leading the way.  According to Marcia Angell,  former editor in chief of the New England Journal of Medicine, there was a 35 fold increase in these claims between 1987 to 2007, and I  suspect this trend, what Professor Angell has skeptically referred to as a Mental Health Epidemic, has accelerated since 2007 given the numbers included in this story (9% of adolescents diagnosed with ADHD).<br/><br/>I've heard of families coaching their children on how to be successfully diagnosed, so that the more talented children are at persuading a clinician the they are suffering from the disorder, the higher the benefit paid to their families. What a waste of talent. Wealthier parents, by contrast, are less motivated to seek SSDI payments, but they often see the treatment for ADHD with amphetamines as something that gives their children a competitive edge in the classroom (and those grueling twenty-four rounds rounds in med school are legendary).
While I enjoy Seth's writing, it's a shame that he does so little touring in his own country. There's just so much he's leaving unexplored proverbially in his own backyard.
The 3rd Ave. El in the Bronx was designated the 8 train for a short time before it was eliminated
I believe it was at the intersection of Brighton Beach Ave.and Coney Island Ave. in Brooklyn
When I first read this, I thought it was a good idea.  Some segments of the South have again declared Civil War on the North, calling themselves patriots and once again viciously targeting black Americans.  But after thinking about it, these gun-toting types would like nothing more than a chance to use their guns.  They feed off of the fear and violence. <br/><br/>So I was thinking that under the 1965 law, which enough people have already died for, they should be legally enjoined from entering the polling place.  I mean, this looks like an old-fashioned clan-like conspiracy to violate civil rights.  If they violate the injunction, they go to jail. I think they would understand that (eventually).  
Good question.  It would depend on the state, but depending on the service they need, one form of id would be their social security card.  Some poor people and elderly do not rely on any social services.
I agree, Matt, and you are right to give the facts.  But he is speaking as an elected representative, and so he should know more about the actual conditions of the people he represents, rather than spouting only what he assumes he knows about people who are not male, white, able-bodied, middle-aged, and privileged like he is.  
Boehner has once again shown that he is not a leader, but a panderer.  If the tea party wants changes to the ACA, do it through legislation, not a tantrum that shuts down the government.<br/><br/>The Senate should, and will, reject this garbage and they should attach a requirement that no member of Congress, or their staff, be paid during a shutdown.  In fact, pay should be forfeited, 
"....the official agreed to discuss planning options only on condition of anonymity...."<br/><br/>Well, that's a good thing.  We sure don't want to tip off our plans in advance!<br/><br/>Maybe just telling them our plans will be sufficient and we will not foolishly proceed to actually attack Syria.  There is no winning strategy for us, or the Syrian people.  Why do we never learn from previous mistakes?<br/><br/>Does the bombs away crowd have a plan to pay for this fireworks show or will we just cut food stamps and education another 10 or 20 percent?
Instead of wasting resources on this non-problem, perhaps our Gov. might invest some effort to insure that Florida voters don't have to stand in line for up to 8 hours to vote.  What a creep.
Uh, raising sufficient revenue to pay for their spending plans?  Or, more accurately stated, balancing revenue with expenses.  Clearly, that is a concept that escapes most in our country.....democrat, republican and certainly the tea party types. <br/><br/>This plan is a terrible idea precisely because of the high risk of moral hazard created.  And, as Kurt NY said, every deadbeat entity will pile in, defaults will be large, essentially creating a federal bailout.  Maybe employees should not be faulted for relying on unrealistic promises.  However, their leaders and the politicians that made the foolish promises, in return for votes, and job security, deserve nothing.<br/><br/>The only solution is the simplest....negotiate reductions in pensions, eliminate them for the politicians, including those now, or due, to collect, until the problem is solved by putting revenue and expense on a sustainable path.  Perhaps Detroit could start by asking the state to impose a special tax on those corporations that benefitted from the last government bailout, the auto industry.<br/><br/>Do not look to me, a recently retired small business owner with no pension other than what I saved, to bail out public employees.  I, and millions like me, are still paying for the 2008 bailout in the form of historically low interest rates on savings.  Meanwhile, big banks get money for nothing and record profits for free, thanks in large part to a totally broken tax system that our politicians will not fix.
Good for you Mayor, I hope you are successful reducing the flow of campaign funds to these parasites who cherish nothing more than the political calculus that enhances their odds of feeding, for their entire life, at the public trough.<br/><br/>If we have learned anything these past few years it is that money is one of the few things that moves these people, hatred and ignorance being close behind.<br/><br/>As for the argument that we are better off with these hacks than a Republican majority, really?  But, that is a topic for another day.
Pathetic.  No matter how the NYT tries to shine up her image in an attempt to make the proverbial silk purse out of a sows ear, the fact remains that Quinn is still an arrogant, out of control bully with anger management issues.  She has shown, on more than one occasion, that her own agenda and desires trump those of the voters and citizens and, therefore, remains ill-suited to the task of leading the great city of New York.
Wonderful article, please continue your efforts to educate on this  issue.  Hard to decide which is of more concern and threatening to our long term survival.....GMO food ecosystems or our gutless, corrupt government. 
Dream on....a large group of Americans, those who aspire to be part of the un-intelligentsia, applaud this boorish behavior by the GOP designed to prolong their careers at the public trough.
Well, congratulations are in order, you succeeded.  However, your political predilections are all too common in our country today.  How sad that the crooked Senator and crooked Dr. pal are not in jail.
Goodbye, good luck.  The Senate will, if that is possible, be a better place without him.  I am sure he will not forget to take his fat pension and benefits with him.....just another entitled "conservative" politician....as he bellies up to the trough for his next big multi-million dollar meal.  Who say public service isn't rewarding?
Your process of understanding and working through your difficult emotional reactions is very instructive.  Yes you are helping parents not just to feel less alone or ashamed about having similar thoughts and feelings, but you model HOW to begin being patient and understanding with yourself and HOW to start working through it.  I think your professional training has given you the perspective and skills to do this, and is helping you immensely here in a way you didn't acknowledge in your reflection.  As a mental health professional and a new parent, I can relate to learning about how my professional skills have applied or not to my experience as a parent.<br/><br/>I also can't use boundaries with my child as I would to stay separate from patients' personal dynamics, but that is a good thing because we SHOULDN'T be doing that in (safe and healthy) personal relationships.  In a sense, this is the inverse of the ethical problems involved in providing mental health care to people you know personally.  Family relationships are supposed to be close enough such that every member has a profound and mutual effect on the others... even when it is surprisingly painful and difficult at times.  Keep up with your process and you will get through this with time and experience.  Your whole family dynamic will be more supportive, positive, and resilient over time as a result.
I doubt that the 12 million pounds is legally enforceable, but otherwise this agreement makes sense. Wikileaks' very survival depends on being secretive.  They certainly can't be held to the same standards of transparency as a government or even a large corporation. <br/><br/>The idea of selling information to publishers is nothing to complain about either.  Nonprofit organizations often charge fees for their services. For example, even though your local Humane Society is a registered charity, you still have to pay money to adopt a pet from it.
