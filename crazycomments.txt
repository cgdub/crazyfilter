God save us all.
Torture was to force confessions to justify war.<br/>
Marx and Engles used dialectical materialis, tricked two thirds of the World population into consensual totalitarianism.<br/>
Cheney is sliding under the fence of converting the Legislative and the Courts under the Executive being the underlying destruction of The US.<br/>
It was treasonable to betray a soldier in the White House.Valary Plame.<br/>
There was no WMD and the Iraq war was planned long before the 911 ever occurred like day one of the Bush Admin.. Ten thousand Marines are dead and one hundred thousand are wounded. The Iraqi citizens 65,000 dead and a million wounded. Three million fled and will not be home soon. .<br/>
Its ironic Tony Blair's World Book Tour was banned in Ireland.The liar claimed he only entered the Iraq war after the 911 happened . The big elephant in the kitchen was who wrote the Downing st memos and who underpinned the fake info you all dished out to Sec Gen Colin Powell.<br/>
The Americans should stop this war monger unleashing a lying legacy of slf justification of slf pitty he could not make an enviormmental disaster that would crush the World in a clean up effort for a thousand years. ..<br/>
He should be tried for putting our boys and girls in harms way unnecessarily.
These tyrannical junta Dictators have fallen so low when you see Mubarak dragged in ,in a stretcher to face killing 300 of his people in Tahrir Square and Assad is looking on as Qaddafi is hiding among the girl guides dresses in the School Convent.<br/>
42 years of oppression and terror ends a Feudal Monarchic system and gives birth in democratising the Globe..<br/>
lately I am proud of America in Wisconsin activating peaceful demonstration in toppling totalitarians using our constitutional rights.<br/>
Yes we can demonstrate the will of the people in a dubious time when our truths are not so self evident. With out sacrifice our system does not work it was not designed to have rich people inherit a legacy to hand down to mad sons.<br/>
In god we trust.<br/>
The lady of satirical eloquence in essence has evolved into a masterful critic.<br />Happiness is still the shadow of love.<br /><br />I think when Jesus walked out of the Jordon, John should have also followed. Our only hope is to know the Messianic age is over and all mankind are the chosen people. We all need a fresh start.<br />Thanks Maureen,What a job. great stuff. Nailed it.<br /><br />
Thanks Frank for saying it like it is. I wish I could write like that. This a fantaboulous article.Great Job i hope Obama and crew read this It is simple and presents a clear picture. Look if Obama took prisoners the result would be worse than the violent reaction we have now. The point is we now have something done. This is not about the American people it's about who's in charge. Loosing Teds seat to Brown woke up the Dems to vote HCR or lose an election . We got the consolation prize with no public option. We the people get the short end when they try and repeal in the name of state rights. This is about race and who is in charge and nothing else. look at the coincidence Greenspan and irregularity is the same time frame as Reagan.
This is all about action replay. JFK got tough and blew Vietnam . Obama must not fall into the same trap. Just keep them trapped in along the third inside rail exposing the Party of NO and getting plenty of gas milage on the dead Health Care issue. Ha Ha If we never got health Care would the Economy be reformed Ha ha. Maureen, you are getting to them. They are on the run,it's clear from the defencive response. The word on the street has great talking points. 
Maybe if we consider all is polarity and male and female he made them in His own image. Adam and Eve walked and talked with God in the cool of the evening. Evil only showed up after the fall. God said don't eat the fruit or you die. We did, and no one died. Consider no evil existed before the fall. The commandment must have been a guide to inherit perfect creativity. Not a choice. Eve did not choose to fall she was beguiled tricked by a serpert a devil an Arc Angel. A Male Spititual being that made the World with God. Adam fell to Eve breaking the commandment and falling into a self centered love relationship. The history is just repeating itself all over the world for all time. My analagy is trying to portray the story. It was not the apple on the tree it was the pare on the ground. God said he accepted Abels offering and regected Cain. This time someone died. Noah got drunk and blew his position of a new begining of only eight people. Abraham blew his position and fell asleep and forgot to cut the birds. Not killing his son redeemed him but slavery prevailed for four hundred years. Joseph was betrayed by all his brothers. Jacob stole a birthright and a blessing with the help of his Mother. Ishmael was thrown out in the dirt. Moses killed an Egyptian , smashed his ten commandments, and struck the rock twice forbiding him to enter the Promised Land. Prostitutes helped Joshua and caleb to enter the The Promised land. John the Bapist asked if jesus was the one or should we look for another.Jesus answered John is the least in the Kingdom of Heaven. Jesus was murdered and condemned for sedition not one single charge held against Him not even the blind kid. I thought the purpose of Christianity was to prepare for the Second Christ. I do no think we are ready. If we prepare as a thief in the night we might be introduced to Heavenly Father and Mother God. My point is Council of Women or anybody should be in Groups. It's time for Mother Chuech to realise a new ae has begun in the midts of great confusion . There is no chosen person, people ,culture, nation , Religion, or Church. All mankind are Gods Chosen people. We are all restored little Adams and Eves returning in love in this complete resurrection Two by Two. Spiritual eternity is a reality.   
It's plain to see nobody knows what is going on. Imagine if she was the VP of our Nation overreving on a Peter principle. "Can I call you Joe". Look it's time we the People compliment ourselves on the Presidential Choice. Mc Cain is exposed as a man choosing a mad woman to handle the VP position of this Nation. Dead fish go with the flow but fiecies always floats. The resounding words of Bill Clinton in the Denver Convention are slowly kicking in. You People are on the wrong side of History. More important to me right now is shovel ready job's and the 10% unemployment rate . Please spend the stimulus package. America needs action right now.
This is just a public defence daughter and all to deter a legal criminal investigative battle, that may result in prosecution. Bill was impeached for a spot on a blue dress. To change history and preserve a legacy is this the motive for all this fan fair. This guy wants to go down in history as the Lord Protector. We know he was President. He thinks he was president George knows he was the Dogs body. Torture is usually to get people to tell what they know. These techniques were used to extract false confessions from people to say Alquaeda was connected to teaching people to manufacture WMDlinking WMD to Saddam ie; Gen Sec Powell presentation in the UN to justify WMD. The Valery Plame eposide blew the whistle. These people had to justify War. There was no WMD and the war in iraq was planned long before 911 ever happened. The 911 Comission clearly states no connection with Alqaeda and Saddam. Remember how Bush 41 said the war in Kuwait was a just war and we were a kinder gentler Nation. Who said we cut and and run, who is cutting and running now. it's only ironic to see Cheney wants the memos released to say torture worked and Obama is second guessing not to release pictures of tortured people. The justification of violence is Marxist Dialectical Materialism. The entire Engles Marx philosophy is based on the justfication of violence. I pray for the new administration to follow a pathway of peace. We must consider eight Nations have nukes. Any man in this age has to be stark raving mad to solve problems with choice one torture viloence and war. The truth is this guy was the President and he will let every body go down with blood in their hands. The thing is two wrongs does not make a right. We thought all along Cheney was transfering the power of the Judicary to the power of the Executive. I think this was the main issue not waterboarding. It's like the transfer of debt transfered from Wall St Bankers to Main St Tax Payers. Then the wrong issue becomes Corp Bonus. Wag the dog. Red became Blue hopfully for the next forty years. Carvelle might have a point to his new book. 
12 million Emmigrant's. 12 Million Unemployed. 12 million don't have health Care. Is this a new game of bait and switch. We refinanced the Banks so who picked up the tab on the toxic asset's. Mr Krugman if the Dow Jones is nearly at a staedy 9 and the price of a barrel of oil is $50 for six months straight how come the Fed Rate is not kicking in. All of a sudden has imports and exports got an effect on our GDP. We can't understand that the subprime mortgages had such an effect on our world global and transnational economy. Even five million foreclosures does not add up to this great calamity. Five million at $150,000 a shot does not even add up to the first tarp payment and now they want us to anti up again. Are we there yet. Are we there yet. Are we there yet.<br />Beware of Greek's bearing Gift's. To big to fail. Remove this phrase from our political dictionary. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS LUCK THE PREPARATORY WORK OF THE CLINTON'S AND TED KENNEDY COMBINED WITH THE OPPOTUNITY OF THE OBAMA PHENOMENON MUST BE WED. THE MARRIAGE MUST TAKE PLACE. Health said "I do" to Care. Illegal Wars cost as much. Tough Love hurt's. Now we know the nature of the beast, Katrina and Ab yu Graib were not the downfall. " To say thoes who are not with me are against me" was. This kind of leadership frightened off 187 National allie's and united our enemie's against us. To be an emigrant is torture. To be out of work is torture. To have no Health care is torture. Now we have given all the oven ready Cake's to the big wig's. Where's all the shovel ready job's. Let's get the led out. 
The first thing to do is teach everybody to regect a Party of no and don't vote for them for Forty years. Banish The GOP from representing people as a Party. I mean revoke their license. Red card no play in the next game. They have been driving drunk on the wrong side of the road for to long. They turned our bank's into Casinoe's The party of no has swown latley meaning Cheney especially to justify himself and not care for the American People. If I go down I will bring you all down with blood on everyones hand's. If you think you won an Election I will make shure you inherit a Global situation that guarantees faliure. Did That. The cards dished out to Obama were ripped from a stacked deck. If we cant have it nobody can. Reagan's wife came up with an empty slogan for people on drugs twenty years ago " Just say no to drug's". Now they laugh at us again with a new slogan for the Homeless. "Get a God Dam House.".<br />I cant take it any more when I read in The New York Times Yesderday. Israel had Nukes, war heads by the hundreds all along. I wondered why The Whole World watched the Mascure and slaughter of Gaza. No one could take them on. I hope obama has the gaul to shoot them down if they break Iran air space. We might have a Billion mad people with guns raging in the middle east. We were all led to believe Iran had one nearly. Maddof is the only guy in Jail for all this mess. Whats up. A half million a month out of work is torture. It used to be 12 million don't have health care now it's twelve million don't have job's. Does this mean we dont need health care. What happened to all the shovel ready projects. Let's get some of the led out. Obama should know the Obstructionists are creating as many distractions as possible to offset his plan . Go Obama, Go Obama. Go Obama. When opportunity meets preperation. That what a job is. There is no such thing as luck. Let's Roll. We are ready willing and able. 
So Condi was just conveying,transmitting,delivering,orders for the White House. Condi now is a conduit following orders in the wake of Colin Powell's resignation. Can she now freely convey to us why she stonewalled the 911 commisssion. One minite you have a flowing conduit and the next a backed up suer. Shame on us if we think black people don't know what torture is. This kind of torture was designed to extract a confession from people to confirm Alqueda was in iraq to justify a War planned from day one before 911 happened with no WMD. Now we have 4270 marines dead over 30,000 wounded , 650.000 Iraque civilians dead. 6 million displaced. and the middle east in a mess. This technique backfired on Pilate when he tortured Jesus, he hoped the people would feel sorry for him and guarantee his release with a pardon. Unfortunatly the mob ruled. Then he washed his hands to save his Position.  
What a fabulous article Mr Herbert. We must continue to remind ourselves to keep the ten yards down. The GOP should be forbidden to represent people for forty years on the grounds they might incriminate themselves. Churchill said in the WW2 "This is your finest hour". Obama inherited a mess and we need jobs yesderday. I for one felt during the Campaign The Party of NO were trying to make a World War Platform to facilitate The son of an Admiral fitting for a war hero. When the platform of terror did not work down went Lehman Bros, yet another ploy to stop the General Election. You must admit when you heard slogans like Bomb,Bomb,bomb Iran, Or We are all Georgians,Or I have posponed my Election Campaign. The biggest divide in America was not Sunday morning at eleven but how Bush and Mc Cain could not meet for fundraisers. My opinion is the GOP showed shame for their own Party from the Getmo. Abu Graib and Kathrina was bad but to say you never expected an attack on The Twin Towers was worse when we were hit in the same building by the same crowd in 1997. I was there. They tried to bomb the basement colums to bring the building down. I think Condi stonewalled lots of info regarding this point to cover up innaction. Three silver bullets could have changed lots of things when they surrounded Bin Laden in Afganistan. My math might be off but Five Million written off Foreclosed Homes at approx 150,000 Dollars a shot is no where near 3.2 Trillion. Or even TARP 7 bill or The Stimilus Package 8 bill. Are we just holding on to a standard of living to keep the Banks on the dole.    
macro or micro econonics, I'm lost "you had me at the fed rate is not funtioning and has no effect on the fluctuation of the elasticity of trade. The Hydron Cholider is up and running again at the end of May.They fixed the freeon Gas leak, more wiered science . We all know the effect of the chain reaction of splitting an attom. Or financing a War for no reason. I think to race atoms into each other at many times the speed of light to experiment what might happen is crazy. The big magnets are supposed to measure the carbon deposits or a new kind of diamond maybe. These guys are having a shot at finding out how God made the World or what is the answer to the theory of the big black hole. At the same time the 2012 metorite is moving past between the sun and the earth the pressure of these events could also be melting the ice and pushing us off our axis. I learned my economics from my mother she said inflation is when you spend beyond your means. I would rather this atomic experiment be carried out in outer space not fifteen miles inside our planet in Europe. Enough. 
Has the Downing St Memo anything to do with the death of Patrick Kelly. I saw an interview between Sir David Frost and Gordon Brown last week in London redredging the facts on the heels of the G20. They were planning to reinvestigate why The Brits were in the Iraq war in the first place. We must consider four investigations already took place including the famous Huntington Report to no avail. The Brits pulled their troops out this week and one hundred people died in Bagdad. Its true what this article is  saying, this baby is not going to bed. There was no WMD and the illegal War in Iraq was planned day one of the Bush Administration according to Bill Woodward's book, Wash Post editor. long before 911 ever happened. Im not looking at memos I'm looking at the shambles of the middle East,The Afgan and Pakistan debockle. Not to mention The Economic Meltdown. Lets face it it was a debt moved from Wall St to Main St Tax Payers with plenty of memos and blame to go around. Pelosi knew is the new defence so the Party of no conclude as usual two wrongs make a right. The great leadership quality of the Bush administration was to unite all our enemies against us. well you might say he did not make a world war ,or stop the general Election. Thank God for not privatizing Social Security. Cheney needs to know the two Gospels, John the Baptist was beheaded for accusing King Herod for sleeping with his brothers wife. simultaniously Jesus was forgiving Mary Magdelene for Adultry, same sin. They were of total opposite persuasions of thought. To me this symbolizes the two doctrines eye for eye and tooth for tooth is replaced by Obama's doctrine a win ,win solution of forgivness and love if you repent. But then again Jesus was crusified so in the end its up to the people of the peope by the people for the people. This time lets not do things right but lets "do the right thing". Imagine if Puncious Pilate had not washed his hands that day and took resposibility, we should not wash our hands of this and let history continue to repeat itself. This Pig is wearing purple eye shadow with FLU like symtoms with epidemic pandemic consequences. This is not an isolated incident it pertains to our Constitution. You cannot move forward with a leaky radiator hose in just a few miles you will have no engine. 
I thought Amendments could be amended by a Refurendum.<br />It's not like legal memos that look like they approve torture to cover your touch in the event of protest,<br />Your article is like the expose of the torture memos but where is the political will of the people. Our moral conscience does not have the steel girders to hold up and underpin the architectural social design. We have gone global with people whom are undisiplined with no regulation or moral conscience. The rules cant even rule Pirates. As long as morality is not entertained into the equasion of Democracy it wont work, This is why we need guns. Evil and God were not part of Karl marx system of Dialectical Materialism, his Social Science left out two major components.It fell because it did not make sense. 76 million people died in WWII, This tells me there is evil, Without the sacrificial endevour of sacrifical people Democracy will not work, Greed and imorality is devouring our great experiment. Obama might say we are not a Christian nation but without the moral development of the charactar of our hearts and spirits, This article will be written next year statistically in greater numbers to no avail. We failed Jesus he did not fail us we left God He never left us. Matt 5,48 You therefore can be perfect as your heavenly Father in Heaven is perfect. Let us strive to build a more Perfect Union.  
Why pick on the Irish. We only have three million citizens an one million Latvians and Polish working for nothing. A slave society with a false sense of economic confidence. You have 250 million people kicking out the Mexicans and you have the moxy to compare yourself to the Irish. I know what you are saying is your self justification our selfishness matches our greed. The great combination that led us down into the pit. Eve was in the Garden looking for a more mature love relationship and found a feel sorry for yourself selfish jelous Satan in the bushes. Adam had not yet discovered his stimulus package. We never even got our fourth of july yet from the British. While you revive your Tea Parties in disruption for the Party of NO. Reveal your sins of Torture but not what the banks did with the TARP MONEY. Double standard. I ALWAYS THOUGHT CONTINGENCY PLAN WAS AN ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT PLAN REFERING TO PLAN B. THE NEW NAME FOR THE WAR ON TERROR. And by the way "La go bragh" means "It's a beautiful day". Did you know Tached cottages are the in thing now and we dont have pigs in the kitchen. Think of it we survived worse than this we used to have eighteen million people before the potato Famine. Now 20% of the population of the US is Irish. That's like one fifth, yes forthy million. Dont fool yourself into thinking Obama got there by the Black vote. Hey Krughman go pick on someone your own size. Fell sorry for yourself someplace else.   
This article is just to get us off Tea bags and Torture.<br />one thing is for shure if this Administration is to move to the next meal. Let's clean off the table. This Emporor never had any clothes. 
Hey Bono .<br /> "It's a beautiful day".<br /> We must compliment The Bush regime that led us down into the pit for three things. 1 He did not start a World War. 2 He did not privatize Social Security. 3 He did not stop the General Election. I don't like Bush but I'm against the blame game. Christianity had a mission to prepare for Christ and no one was ready introducing Communism and three world wars. Now The Southern Bapist Christian right, Our Congress and Senate including the British Parlement and many nations voted for the War in Iraq. The blame game does not work. We must look at ourselves and participate in the process. My mantra is there was no weapons of mass destruction and the war in Iraq was planned from day one of the Bush administration long before 911 ever took place. I hope the world ignoring the Gaza mascure does not give the moxy to Natanyahu to bomb, bomb, bomb, Iran. Otherwise we could have an echological disaster that would take one thousand years to clean up.<br /><br />Thanks Bono, and your great group U2. You do the Irish proud we truly love you for all that you do. I read your Da was the guy who believed in you guy's and gave you the few quid to cut the first album. I would not argue with him we all owe him. He made you guys and believed in you all. Some day you will talk to me I'm a Dubliner thats been around and God has given me a message for you He told me He loves you and a time will come and you will know it's me it shall be revealed to you thoes three special words . "He is here".<br /><br />Kieran O'Neill. "Yea The O'Neill Clan". 
O Yea. Where is Universal Health care promised by<br />CLINTON,OBAMA,AND KENNEDY. Dashel is gone now whats up. The big 20 dump a trillion on the world sceen. 12 million have no Health Care in the US. The Clintons promised with no delivery in their tenure. Whats up. Wagnor got a 20 million golden parachute. Yea we were angry about the last eight years. The Pentagon did not reduce costs and eliminate expenses to justify a war. The biggest problem to balance the budget is being shoved in our faces as the reduction of Health Care expences. Nobody said anything in balancing a budget for the unjust war. We want Universal Health Care yea 12 million People. Dont start explaining us away all thoes in Europe have it. Smiles and phychology did not get this administration where they want to be. They promised health Care. Now it's being explained away. We haven't seen a first down. All we see is nuclear warheads flying over japan. Not to mention Iran shooting up a sputnic latley. After 911 why even take a chance. These guys could scramble our communications. 
Two commedians made a name for themselves and pumped up their ratings calling us out without laughing. This is the cost of doing business. Whats the big polemic. This is not a Katrina moment. This is a malox moment after eight years of Bush and failed policies. You cannot expect Obama to be called out on every toilet roll missing from the bathroom. I doubt he will say I screwed up on this one. If it's not Rent on a limo a lapsed tax payment or 2% Porky the Pig it is seen to be perfect obstructionism that ties up the boat at the dock as we rev full steam ahead making lots of white splashing water going nowhere. Ironically some of the Republicans are for paying the bonuses now.  The Republicans are so elated to have a new whipping boy Geithner to defame the ratings of a popular President. Look they got one in the basket. Even in basket ball people win on technical fouls. Whats the big polemic on miniscuel bonuses that can be retracted when the real problem is eighteen years of no regulation creates an AIG monster in forty seven foreign foreign countries with a budget four times bigger than Home Land Security. look don't sweat the small petti stuff it's just the cost of doing business in the age of corruption. What shall become of us if God forbid Michelle surges with a splurge to buy new dishes for the White House. The more things change the more they stay the same. One thing I would suggest is everybody is on Geitner and rightly so expressing how techy and smart he is but he lack's the art of salesmanship. Have you ever seen what happens to your sales when you let the mechanic talk to the customers. We need to sell the sizzle not the grizzle. I will be sad for America if the hard working successful people are punished for being successful.     
Hey Blow, a plough horse and a race horse both eat grass. The thing is the race horse makes more money. I can't shoot hoops like Mike Jordon or score goals like Becham. The American dream is we are not punished for being successful. if these guys got busted they must have been a bubble. The thing is this is OUR money and these are the very guys that sank the Titanic lieing cheating and stealing sticking it to us taking the most for the least. These guys did not earn this money we did and we lent it to them in hope. To big to fail is a treat we fell for. This culture of no regulation in the last eighteen years got so big and arrogant it bloated out Companies like AIG to be four times the size of The budget of Home land Security and fanged out it's tazor edge teeth and claws into forty six Countries around the globe. We must humble to the arrogance and quickly blame ourselves and pamper it's pride and feed them with big bonuses or else we are told the world would stop. I don't mind bailing out the boat but this is our boat. Obama gets it it's Global. Thanks for your candor allowing us to vent our anger but I don't think the word in your first paragraph should be "Gambled" it should be "SABOTAGE". I STILL THINK LEHMAN BROS WAS THE HOSTAGE THROWN OFF THE PLANE TO ENSURE SERIOUS DISCUSSION FOR TARP, SO AS THEY COULD FLY AWAY WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE'S TAX DOLLARS. When you mess with the system it bites you. Just like the smartallic school children moved the clock forward an hour to get out of school early. The next morning the were all late for school. The system is so broken that when they cry wolf we kill the shepard. Obama is not worried about rocking the boat but lets get this boat off the rocks. How can we go fullsteam ahead when the party of NO consistently tie up the boat at the dock. Last week Dashel went down for not payin rent on a limo now we have no health care Zaar. The week before we dealth with 2% Porkey the Pig. This is not a time to tax Taxes on money we invested to create credit. What will it be O God forbid if Michele splurges and buys new dishes for the white House. Yes we Can.    
Christopher Hitchens says that Religion Poisons Everything. Is he right? Well the recent killing of coptic Christians in Egypt prove that hate among so-called religious still there and we don't really know where this problem is supposed to end. The arab spring really brought democracy or it is just another Muslim crusade to eliminate the non-muslims? The Egyptian people managed themselves to kick Mubarak out by expecting to have a true democracy. Guess what? They dug their own funeral hole. There is no democracy in this world. "democracy is the worst form of government except all the others that have been tried." (Winston Churchill). Why? Because the Devil can influence people's votes and plunge them into killing themselves.
This is the primary reason that I stopped watching NBC and MSNBC!  They consistently make incendiary comments,  and many times they are not supported by even the flimsiest of facts.   I guess to some MSNBC is an alternative to FOX,  but it seems to most viewers that FOX is a paragon of virtue when compared to MSNBC.   It appears MSNBC with their screaming,  attacking,  and demeaning is more like RUSH,  and I can only take so much of him.   We need to pull together as a nation and with this kind of stuff continually on the airwaves it is going to be hard.
I was a Republican for 30 years and changed to Independent a couple of years ago because of Bush's endless wars.  I have always believed the Republican party cared about the middle class.  I was wrong!   The Ryan budget proves one thing.   They one care about corporations,  the rich,  and the elite in this country.   On morning Joe today I heard the comment that no amount of means testing could solve the Medicare issues.   This is a flat lie.   The upper middle class and the rich love their free health care and they want to keep it.   They do not want to pay more nor do they want their taxes increased to protect the poor or help the middle class never mind it was the middle class for the last 70 years that has indirectly paid more than their fair share.   The money that was to go into to medicare and social security was going into the general fund.  For the most part it was the people who made under $100,000 that was paying the lions share for Social Security.  So I think it is reasonable to argue the middle class has paid more than they were suppose to pay in taxes the last 60-70 years.   Medicare and Social Security can solve their problems easily through means testing.   Here is the formula:    First,   Means test Social Security.    Second,   All income over $108,000 is subject to an additional 4% Social Security tax.  This would be in addition to the means testing.  Third,  Medicare would be means tested.    Fourth,   those with incomes and savings that provide them more than $250,000 per year would pay full premium for medicare and their deductible would be $15,000 for part A and $7,500 for Part B.   Those with incomes in retirement of $100,000 to $250,000 would have a $10,000 ded for part A and a $5,000 for part B.   Those with incomes of $50,000 to $100,000 in retirement would have a $5,000 Part A and a $2,500 for part B.   Those with incomes of less than $50,000 in retirement would pay based on a graduating scale,  but only the poorest would enjoy the current situation of only $150 ded for part B.   I don't want to hear any garbage about Medicare and Social Security not working.  The problem is the upper middle class,  the rich,  and the elite want their taxes low and they want all their government goodies as well.   Currently,  all these talking heads on TV make millions of dollars and none of them want to pay additonal Social Security taxes or have their benefits means tested nor do their want to pay the full premium for Medicare and have a high ded for part A and B,  but that is exactly what needs to happen.   This is exactly the way it should have been set up to begin with.    It was a crime for Roosevelt to allow the rich to draw Social Security but not to pay for it on their entire earnings.   This talk of raising the age of retirement is a NON-STARTER..........Yes people are living longer,  but they are not necessarily healthier.   All we would do if we increase the age is force more people to file disability.   It is time we woke up and changed these policies to suit the situation.   Medicare part A and B for the rich should essentially be a major medical plan.    Medicare part A and B for those making 50-100 should have a sizable ded. and only for the retired poor should medicare be as it is currently today.   Any talk of a voucher system designed to keep future costs down to protect the rich, elite and those in the upper tax brackets is a non-starter.   Americans are waking up to the fact that most of our countries problems started with the tax reductions of 1980.   The great Presidency of Ronald Reagan has bankrupted this country!    We need to put our house in order,   but we are not going to do it by continuing Social Security checks for the rich.   Nor by allowing the rich to protect their full income from Social Security or the rich reaping the benefits of Medicare and not paying the full premium.   THE TIME HAS ARRIVED AND THE WEALTHY HAS TO START PAYING FOR THEIR PERKS!!!!!!!!!!!!  
What I am going to say is going to sound harsh,  but I believe it is the only hope we have to deal with this third world terrorism.   We survived and thrived during the cold war because of a simple concept of mutually assured destruction.   Both sides understood that if either side launched their nuclear armaments it would mean both countries and probably the world would be destroyed.   Currently,   we have dozens of small countries that are allowing terrorist inside their borders because they believe and support the very things those terrorists are fighting for.   At the same time these countries are giving us lip service,  excepting our money,  minimal help and support.   They aren't really in an all out war to root out these terrorists.   It simply is not in their interest to do so.  Imagine this scenario.   There are 1,000 Americans traveling the globe butchering arabs,  blowing up middle easter property and generally committing carnage and mayhem.   Do  you think such a thing could happen anywhere in the world?   No it could not because no one in the world is going to financially support,  sympathize with,  or shelter any American engaged in terrorism.   These terrorists have dozens of countries and millions of people who will either help them or turn a blind eye to their behavior.   Even in European countries they are allow to stand on the street corner and preach their hate without impunity.   So what is the answer.    Anything less than a strategy similar to the cold war strategy will not work.   We have to treat countries and communities that harbor and help these people as our enemies and take them down.   We have to announce to the world that if a nuclear, biological,  or chemical weapon is detonated in our country we will find out the nationality of the people ultimately behind the disaster and that country will pay.   That means countries like Saudi Arabia will have to stop allowing their schools,  and religious institutions to preach and teach hate.   Countries like Iran,  Pakistan,  Syria etc. will be told the first time we are attacked if their people are involved they will be attacked.  No more giving them money which they turn around and give to the terrorists.   TIME TO GET TUFF!   Better we do it now before the disaster occurs.   The American people will not stand for it when it comes so you have better start making the necessary changes NOW!  
The Democrats mishandled Health Reform!    They determined to impose a nationwide system of health care regardless of how angry it made the American people.   They did this without Republican support and only about 35% of the American people in agreement.   The first time in 60 years that a program, of this significance, was foisted on the country without the other party being involved and without the support of the people.  Democrats came to the conclusion they had a veto proof Senate and regardless of the horrible economy were going to push the bill through.   They succeeded in imposing their will,  but now comes the payback for this ill conceived plan.  I do not believe,  in the final analysis,  the American courts are prepared to pass on this bill, considering the above facts.   It is going to come down to one Supreme Court Judge!   I just can't see the court allowing a small minority to determine 1/6 of the economy, when it involves such a contentious issue.   The best thing the Democrats could do is sit down at the table with Republicans and rework the entire thing before this reaches the Supremes.   I don't think the Democrats want to have the 2012 election shortly after a negative ruling of Health Care. 
Two weeks ago on another site I predicted Keith Olbermann would get fired in 2011!  I am alittle surprised it happened so quickly.   However, this guy was revolving around some galaxy many light years from this one.   This simple fact is this guy was killing NBC and for that matter all of network news.   Multiplied millions have stopped watching all programming on the big three because ABC, NBC, CBS have become megaphones for the left.   This guy and all the network new divisions are dragging down their networks regular programming.   People are infuriated with the slanted and steady diet of distorted news they are getting to the point FOX has become the only source of news for half the country.   It is way past time for the major news outlets to clean house.   The news divisions should for the most part reflect the market.   People are paying good money for CNN, and MSNBC,  Fox,  and they have a right to expect some semblance of fairness.   ABC has illustrated how far off the deep end they have fallen with their acquisition for their Sunday morning line up.   They had a powerful middle-of-the road newsman in Jake Tapper and they chose to go outside and get another reporter off the deep end.   People are just totally fed up with this foolishness and are canceling newspaper subscriptions,  and turning off CNN and the big three.   I predict CHANGES ARE COMING!   
I have never read an article more foolish or one I disagree with more than this silly article.  To suggest the country went to the polls, not even ten days ago, and in one of the most historic elections, threw out 64 Democrats from the house and then to suggest the people didn't really want to do this is, at the least, hair brained!  This kind of thinking is going to hurt the Democrats in the next election.   It seems to go along with the other nonsense we hear coming from Democrats like;  the electorate is stupid,  uneducated,  care only about their guns and bibles,  didn't understand what we were doing.   The American people know exactly what is going on in this country and they didn't approve of most of it.   If the Democrats continue to lie to themselves they are going to face an even worse disaster in the next election.   The American people hate pelosi and reed,  they want smaller government,  they want a balanced budget,  taxes kept to a minimum,  congress to work together and compromise on solving the social security and medicare issues.  Most of all they want congress to revisit health care and craft a truly bi-partisan bill.   If two years pass and non of these things get worked on there will be more Democrats and maybe Republicans shown the exit. 
Nancy Pelosi may have done a great job!   And she may be remembered as a powerful and successful Speaker!  However,   she seems to be in a state of total delusion.   This is the only the second time in my life that the Democrats have allowed themselves to become totally deluded.   Jimmy Carter was in a state of delusion and from his recent comments he still is.  Now we have Barach Obama who seems to be a carbon copy of Carter.  He is operating in a state of delusion.   He constantly attacks his own Democrats and Republicans when the American people want him to LEAD!!!   That means stop attacking and take responsiblity and work to make things better.   Are you capable of making things better?  I am beginning to wonder.
Too little to late!    He always has to increase taxes or take away tax breaks from someone in order to fund one of his pet projects.   He Never Cuts Anything!   That is why we are in desperate shape in this country.
It needs fixed Now!
I am conservative and not opposed to playing politics  but in this case we need to fix the problem and not the blame.   After the problem is fixed and cleaned up we can point fingers.   Personally,   I would like the President to give this the kind of seriousness he would give a Chernobyl like accident!!!!!  I wish he would call a meeting Tuesday morning at the White house and bring the brightest minds from the four corners of the globe to bear on this issue.   Tell the Navy beginning today the spill is their problem!!  Working with BP they are to stop the leak ASAP and clean the mess up and this is a NUMBER ONE NATIONAL AGENDA!    NOTHING LESS WILL DO.    We can't sit  back for the next 3-4 four months and watch BP play the American people like they are doing.    This disaster has to be handled and it has to be handled NOW nomatter what the cost!
People are sick of the one sided news reporting and you get a load of it on CNN!   They just don't want to change.   Most of the networks losing money won't move away from the liberal model even tho people are sick of it and even tho it is costing them money.   So they can send their message out into the ethos with no one watching.
I use to watch CNN much more than I do now.   I rarely watch any news programs and when I do I watch FOX.  I am weary with the one sided reporting and I think the majority of Americans feel the same way.   I really do not like one sided reporting.   I am sickened by what I see on MSNBC.   CNN needs to be totally down the middle and it needs to be much more combative.   Democracy is a combat sport!   Democracy is a war with bloodshed.   CNN seems to think they can pretend to be middle of the road but they are anything but middle of the road.   Middle of the road means you have guests arguing all sides of an issue and the monitors aren't all liberal in their politics.   CNN needs to get with the program.   If they continue the way they are they will cease to be a force in American news. 
For the first time in a long, long time I actually felt good about the two rulings that came out today by the Supreme Court.   I actually thought they finally "got it".    It isn't about some dead document or some political agenda it is about "us".     What is best for "our" country.    Finally,   somebody has started doing something that was good for our country.     
The last thing this country needs is another lying Senator!   Please with the problems our country faces we do not need lied to we need politicians who have the guts to speak the truth.   This fellow has a basic character flaw and that is another thing we don't need another Senator with major character flaws.   When are we going to wake up in this country!
As a conservative republican I would like to see a moderate appointed to the supreme court.   I am not naive enough to think that is going to happen.   Considering the choices Obama put forward to pick from I think this Kagan woman is as good as any.   I think it is a mistake to make a big fight over this pick.   We need to stay focused on the election.   Attacking this woman would only seem narrow and unwarranted by the American people.   Right now Republicans are in a position to gain seats in the fall an attack on Elena Kagan could not help our position in the fall.   In fact,   I think it is not in the best interests of either party to fight over the supreme court pick this summer.   People are in a angry state of mind and there is no way to know exactly how the American people would react to attacks regarding a Supreme court pick.   My advice let her go onto the court without any fanfare.   
If your logic is correct would you apply it to John F. Kennedy or how about Robert Kennedy.   How about applying your distorted logic to Martin Luther King Jr.   Maybe you have heard the axiom that goes,  "that which proves to much proves nothing."   Such is the case with your proofs regarding moral behavior and particular members of society.   People act out for a lot of reasons and many of those reasons have little to do with morals.   Sometimes they are a reflection of the tremendous amounts of stress certain people put themselves under.   Then again some of us just compartmentalize our lives.   Whatever I am growing very tired of the media types drawing to much from a 32 year old billionaire acting out in mid-life.    He is not a politician!    Please get out of his life and just leave him alone and give the rest of us a little rest. 
This is not the USSR despite what the Democrats think!   Come November we intend to show them what we think.   They are going to pay and pay dearly for betraying the American people 
As a lifetime Republican I am going to be very very disappointed if my fellow Republicans don't get totally behind these reforms.   This is the kind of bill I think has been needed for a very long time.   Republicans should oppose the President when he is wrong  but when he is right they should get on board.   In the case of this education bill he is absolutely right.   REPUBLICANS SHOULD FAST TRACK THIS BILL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
I am an Independent.   I voted for Barach Obama!    However,   I do not approve of highhanded tactics to overrule the American people.   I think if the Democrats do this it will be a catastrophe for Democrats on par with what watergate was for Republicans.
This is the first article I have read about Health care that I have agreed with.   I think first if they want this thing to pass they will have to change the name and call it something other than Health Care legislation.  In addition,   your ideas to keep costs down are super but I don't think the Democrats will ever buy into it.  You know if the Democrats hadn't gone into this thing with the attitude of take it or leave it and we are goin get all we can get and included Republicans from the beginning and especially if Obama had had the guts to take on the Lawyers from the beginning we would have a bill right now.   Here we are a year later and his presidency is on the line and he still won't take on the lawyers.   It is too bad but bi-partisanship always seems to be directed at the Republicans by the media,   but I see little or none of it from Democrats.   Our whole country is in sad shape because we need to get away from political parties and start getting pragmatic before it is too late.  However,  having said that I am furious that the Democrats have wasted two years messing with this at a time when we need some many other things done.
Like most Americans I am just worn out with this foolishness!   I don't understand how we have a president who goes on national television asking for bipartisanship the very day he releases a bill that epitomizes that very thing.     He knows how sick the country is of this issue!   He knows we are practically bankrupt!   He knows that the majority of Americans are against this bill!   And yet he persists!   I just don't understand when he only has six months to get legislation passed before the election to try and get his party out of the deep hole they have dug for themselves and he goes back and starts again on what appears a losing issue.   I do sympathize with the President he came so close,   but you just can't do things of this magnitude without the support of the American people.   I don't see these skittish congressman passing something like this.   I can't imagine how damaging it will be to the Democrats if they were to spend the next 6 months arguing over this bill.   I am 60 years old and this is the first time I have ever seen a political party risk so much so close to an election.,
The Democrats really have no one to blame for this but themselves.   Bayh has been pretty well and he had a better than average chance of winning.   The moderates in the Senate are sick and tired of this extreme liberalism and the chronic bickering it is causing in our country.   The simple fact is the people do not support Obama and the liberal Democrats and their agenda.   It appears against the will of the people they are going to try and use reconciliation to ram it down our throat which result in nothing short of an all out war.    Democrats are going to continue losing some of their best if they persist in this hopeless and hapless path they have chosen.
I am reluctant to give Haiti any money until they turn those baptists loose!    We are spending billions helping them and they lock up 10 people trying to help them.   I don't believe for a minute those 10 people were trying to market those children.

Obama is not up for election so why should he compromise!   After all he is not the one who is going to have to go home at the end of this year.   His career will not end at the end of 2010.   You can bet the speech he gave tuesday night would have been substantially different if he was up for reelection.   That is why he is a total hippocrite!   Frankly,   he intends to push his bogus socialist agenda as long as he can.   So we can expect, one degree or another,  the same issues that have infuriated the American people will be shoved down our throats between now and the fall.   Of course,   you can be certain the speech he gives next January will be quite contrite.   It won't do him any good.   The American people see him for what he is;  a arrogant,  self-involved,  promoter who doesn't understand the people of this country or really care about them.   Expect his party to fall and afterward the demise of the great one.    
I must say how surprised  I am by the negativity toward Ms Gilbert and Eat Pray Love. She's a writer who went on a very interesting journey paid for by a publisher and then wrote about it,  How pathetic the nasty envy for a balanced, happy extremely generous, honest human being. Such petty thinking.  Isn't a wealthy, independent woman allowed to have her story and write about it. Lighten up people. And those who never read it, do not judge the book by the movie. 
Elizabeth Gilbert is a joy to read, listen to and think about. Her understanding and openess about  the mystery of life give such comfort. . As John Keats wrote, "a thing of beauty is a joy forever," and Elizabeth has created that in herself and her work.  Humans will be reading her encouragement of existence always. I thank her very much for sharing herself so. Her words and being help me.
Consciousness exists in many dimensions.  
The Mayor needs to slip into a Twilight Zone episode where he is poor and a minority and is constantly stopped and frisked wherever he goes. Then he may have empathy for the horror of this policy. 
Stop and frisk is  a very dangerous risk to basic American laws of this land. Dangerous neighborhoods need more surveillance, but the stop and frisk policy goes against America's civil law principle, and we must guard against abuse of any kind by not allowing it. In airports they announce what we are subject to, so we know what to expect, but in front of people's residences, walking in the neighboorhood, no. We must protect our rights no matter what the nighborhood. The police just must walk the beat and hope they see a crime in progress, or very, very suspicious activity. Stopping and talking, yes, stopping and frisking an invasion of privacy.
Marvelous column, Maureen.  Recently I watched the movie, The Shoes of the Fisherman from 1968, and remembered how when the Russian Pope puts  up all the Church's wealth to save the Chinese people from starvation and avoid a world war. If only the Catholic chruch truly lived by the true teaching of Jesus, to love thy neighbor as thyself, to live simply.  The Catholic Church will have to change as the world is changing, communicating, discovering the truth of one humanity all trying to survive on this planet.
Yes, leaps of faith can take us to the most rewarding places. Luckily for Don Quixote, he just found himself in the meadows. Too many have to actaully fight the serpents and lizards in the the black bog in order to get through to the beauty. Like sane people have to fight through the Republican leadership of the house.
Thank you for writing about Mr. Meyers.  The love surrounding him, his love of life and his acceptance of losing such precious mementos with grace. I agree with him so on one needs a bed, clean underwear and a shower to be able to face life everyday with enthusiasm. I especially love the three glasses of wine a day.
Dear Dick,<br/><br/>Among all the horror and sadness in the world today, your essay is truly a pleasure to read. I'm so glad you made it aboard and shared with us your harrowing experience. You are a treasure Mr. Cavett. You did deserve an audience for your leap, and the ship should never have left without you
I still am baffled by the number of votes Romney won. How could ignorance be so close in a race against truth and  intelligent scientific facts of life? We, the winners of further enlightenment, must continue to fight for truth. We must help those who are born into ignorance have access to education to learn facts that support humans continuing on this exquisite planet.  In scientific earth time, humans have only been here for two seconds on a trwenty-four hour clock. I sure hope we make it to at least five seconds before we wipe ourselves out. There is hope.
Thank you for writing about this. I spoke of Rubio's statement at Thanksgiving dinner. We must never let up on ignorance trying to be truth. Science is what is by repeated experiment and study. Religion are stories by men that may be inspired by God, but they're not truth, just faith. Scientific proof must always be taught in schools.
Ego, ego, ego and boredom, boredom, boredom, even for Generals, and heads of  the CIA, and some past presidents.  Yes, sex and envy make people stupid, but.... the aforementioned is really what it is about. 
The House Republicans will be watched very carefully. Balking at helping fix the problems of the country rationally, will send them further and further into the fanatical fringe. Then, hopefully, the country will give the Democrats the ability to fix with logic and sacrifice of all understood, win both houses and make the country strong and fiscally responsible once again.. 
Good writing, but the ridiculous description of the President is really pathetic.  He's energized by the truth and that many, such as, Powell, Christie and Bloomberg realize the future of America in reality is no phantom theory anymore. We have no control over the weather and we better take the climate seriously, as well as human and women's rights. We need a brilliant, rational, compassionate President, and they acknowledged it finally.  I believe the President is going to win, and it will be so wonderful to have Romney disappear back into his hypocritical, stand for nothing, life.
Those are commendable pro-life causes that Mayor Bloomberg has instigated, but what about stop and frisk, and allowing male police officers to frisk females. An innocent woman being frisked against her will by men because she is a minority is a form of molestation so horrific,.. well, it is right up there with the thinking of Akin, Mourdock, and Walsh. Mayor Bloomberg is not giving those women a right to choose.
Sorry, Maureen, but I think you have done your sister Peggy a real disservice by telling us how backward and, yes, stupid she is to think about voting for a known liar like Romney that stands for nothing, and a vice presidential candidate that thinks a just fertalized egg is a human being.  It would be hard for me to have any respect for a sister like that. 
Your column is the most perfect explanation of the Romney/Ryan platform. Extreme lies to go along with their extreme idiology. Two very scary men who will say anything to gain power. It terrorizes me that  there are so many who believe them. Thank you.
Oh, Maureen, how can you bear the thought of a Romney/Ryan win?  They want to control women's bodies like the Taliban. The thought that there are so many people willing to give up the freedoms that women and minorities around the world have fought for by voting for these two close minded men scares me more than Bush Cheney and look at the hell they' put us through. President Obama is a brilliant, honest, decent, caring man who has devoted his life to public service and the other two are self serving white men that don't deserve the office they seek. I will be heartsick and despondent if R&amp;R win, and I'll volunteer the next day at Planned Parenthood.  Maybe I'll do that anyway, because President Obama must win.
I was very disappointed in President Obama's lack of attack at all of Mitt Romney's lies. However, Mitt Romney lied throughout, just his delivery was good. I'm hoping that conservatives will be so shocked at last night's performance by fake Democrat Mitt Romney, they won't vote for him now
Fat bullying has been going on and on and on. However, as much as I realize that there is an obesity epidemic, the constant discussion of the negativity of being overweight will give people an excuse to bully. I don't believe anyone chooses to be fat. Study after study show that overweight bodies crave food the way an alcoholic's body craves liquor. Yes, some people are much stronger than others and can fight the urge to eat successfully. Food addiction is the most prevalent addiction that shows on the human body. We must be very careful how we stigmatize overweight children, or life will become even more unbearable from the cruelty. 
I think, Maureen, you hope Romney does win, so you'll have more to write about that makes sense when you castigate a President. President Obama's speech did not in any way blame the people. He was saying that the problems were so enormous, and the Republicans so bent on his destruction that it is taking longer to solve them, and he needs four more years to make sure we stay on the right course to make this happen. Romney and Ryan will set the country back to the fifties in ignorance and lack of tolerance.  I understand your need for controversy, but I don't believe you believe what you're writing. 
No, President Obama is protecting a woman's right  to protect and govern her own body.  I'm positive the President wants it to be safe, legal and RARE, just like anyone else with common sense. But, it must remain the woman's decision.
I'm so glad, Maureen, that you are stating the scary truth about Romney and Ryan. Comparing Mitt to President Obama is truly as bizarre to me as the question, 'Did you bring your lunch or did you walk to work.' No sense at all. President Obama is running for America, not just his base. He wants to protect us from the right wing terrorizing zealots of the Republican party, and I do think that men who want to control women's bodies the way Ryan really does is on the road to Taliban thinking.  And Romney choosing such a man is on the same level as McCain picking Palin, pathetic. Anything to win, but a good excuse if they lose.<br/><br/>The President has kept America going.... no we are not out of the woods, but he said over and over when he was running in 2008 that it was a long road ahead for recovery and he has kept us on the right track.  <br/><br/>.
Venus and Serena are very nearly perfect in their tennis, manners, truth and fineness.  Their parents raised two normal yet brilliant women.  I agree they should never go back to Indian Wells. Thank you, Venus and Serena for giving us so much pleasure and excitement.  
Romney, Ryan, Cheney, W represent the white male and many a white female that are terrorized of losing control in this country. They are not willing to accept the changes of a country and world, and especially the climate.  It staggers me that after all the history of this planet, the obvious truths of science and evolution we allow ignorance to rule so many humans just born into it... and through constant communication, the ability for ignorance to be accepted in the media as truth.  Two men are running for office that have no empathy for the struggle of life for so many. They only want the status quo of the few having it all, the wealth and the power. I have to believe that intelligence, belief in the truth as proven by repeated situations through time will get us through the ignorance and selfishness of the now republican party.  A true and rational essay, Maureen. 
Sounds like it's time to put this weiner between 2 buns and call it a day.
Destruction and chaos is a wonderful way to remember Trayvon Martin.  These people are so ridiculous that they would ruin the memory of a young man killed.   You are not honoring his memory by hurting others.  I blame all this on the media.  They started all of this months and months ago, it didn't have to go this far.  Stupid.
I'll bet his wife is so emotionally beat down by this egomanic that she can't leave him.  
I think we have already seen enough of this clown.  Are you kidding me?  
That is ridiculous.
The cops that work in schools are not retired.  They are active duty officers assigned to schools.  
I think that is what we have to do.  This and banning assault rifles should work, but if there is really a crazy person intent of doing something horrific...he will.  
I have experienced severe childhood truama.  In my thirties I decided to go see a therapist for my depression, "morbid depression" I was labeled.   We went through the trauma and I came out fine.  I am now in 53 been happy for years, and think people do not work hard enough to get themselves "right".  We rely on medicating people instead of helping them do the work.  I am no therapist but do know what can work.  How can someone be on antidepressant medication for years and years?  I'm not talking about bipolar or psychotic disorder.
It seems to me that more and more people everyday are suffering from "Narcissistic personality disorder ".  I don't remember so many people thinking they were so self important.  Just look at our Sports figures and Government Officicals.  People used to be humble.  What the heck happened?  Does society make people "catch" narcissistic personality disorder?  Have parents done something to their children?  We all know people who have this disorder.  We usually call them jerks, but are they sick?
Well it's about time.  Thanks for dragging your feet Mr. Bernanke.  Interesting this happens just prior to the presidential election...
Hmm, sounds like Mr. Obama thinks he thought this up all on his own.  Didn't this plan get implemented under the Bush administration?  What exactly has Mr. Obama done for any of us?  How many of us have either been or are unemployed with the promise creating more jobs?  How many of us have lost our homes because Mr. Obama thought it more important to partner with China regarding STREETLIGHTS of all things, then to come up with a plan to really help Americans who have worked hard save their homes from foreclosure?  Get this do nothing President out of office!

Get Obama out of office and you will see the unemployment rate dramatically drop.  Businesses are afraid to hire with Obama in office. I know I am.  He claims to have saved the auto industry...then wouldn't there be a ripple effect to the economy?  The unemployment has not been under 8 percent in 41 months, how long does it take Obama to turn things around?
Blame it on Obama.  His stupid "bail out" didn't help anyone.  I suspect the Banks think they dupped him and are hopeful he'll do it again before his term is up.  I think it's time we stop leaving everything up to Government and get more involved.  This is ridiculous and I for one am sick of it.
Obama probably didn't even know what was going on...he strikes me as that type of President.  He can't answer the questions because he is oblivious to what went on.  Obama needs to pay attention.  The Border Patrol officers shouldn't have to sacrifice their lives because of our President is too busy going to Sarah Parker's house instead of knowing what is going on under his Presidency.  Get him out of the White House!
