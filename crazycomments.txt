The Republicans are "downright giddy"? Their actions prompted "cheers and chants" among them? They sport "beaming grins"?<br/>Shameful. Tragic.<br/>This has nothing to do with what is best for Americans. It has everything to do with the Republicans' sustained attack on the elderly, the poor, the middle-class, and the President. 
Ted Cruz is no Wendy Davis. But I urge him to keep up the histrionics. Eventually, even his supporters will realize that he's just a loose cannon who has enjoyed more than his 15 minutes of fame. Buh bye ...
To leave messages with children, spouses, and on answering machines as Mr. Copeland and Mr. Hjort do after being rejected is wrong, wrong, wrong. Conscience cannot be forced. Having been married to a Vietnam veteran for many years and then divorced, I can assure you that these households live with issues stemming from Vietnam and no one needs to add to them. It is a personal choice of the veteran whether or not he wants to make contact. That Mr. Copeland did is his business and the price he is paying is his to endure. There is obviously much behind his story. How can he presume to know what's best for another family? 
Some of these comments make me cringe. Do only owners of "complicated" rescue dogs understand? I very much enjoyed -- and appreciated -- your essay. As I sit here typing with my old Mol lolling next to me on one of her multiple memory foam beds (provided by my second husband, who didn't want her old bones resting on our tile floors -- and why didn't I think of that?) that are strewn around the house, I am reminded of the many times I/we tried to socialize her. In the end, she always has preferred our sunny deck and the safety of our fenced yard. Like you and Chance, Mol and I are aging together. It's bittersweet -- your eloquent essay captures the experience very well. Thank you.
Several years ago before my mom passed we were cleaning out some of her drawers and she found a booklet she received when she was in high school (public, circa 1930s). It was a manual for young ladies that included sex education, or whatever it was called then because there was little that would be considered educational in the booklet. Basically, it was filled with guilt directed at women. Pretty much everything a female thought about desire, let alone acted upon, was unseemly. I wonder how far we've come from that manual, given the current issues that face women today. 
Here's one for your blooper box, NYT: High school cafeterias don't have "chefs." (If they did, perhaps there'd be fewer dropouts.) And if his mother indeed was a chef, I doubt she'd have been working in a high school. That said, nice obit. 
Still another article detailing another attempt to define this complex educational issue and solve it with a simplistic fix. We began to lose this war when the business of education was taken out of the hands of educators and politicized. Class size matters ... and teacher quality matters ... and administration matters ... and district population matters ... and socioeconomic makeup matters ... and geographical location matters ... and a host of other issues individual to a school district matter. There is no one fix. There never will be. And until politicians get out of our schools and allow professional educators to do their jobs we are not going to solve the problems dealing with educating our children in the 21st century. 
I, too, taught TGG and am delighted to see people reading it, whatever cover they choose. Having taught Am. Lit. for years, I frequently dealt with students questioning the  "no happy ending" aspect of the literature they read. One year (early in my teaching career), I provided, quite inadvertently, a moment of levity in class when I attempted to draw on the board a visual representation of East Egg, West Egg, and the bay in between. You can guess the result. Needless to say, for the next several years students "innocently" asked me to draw the map. I declined. (There's a reason I taught literature and not art.)
I agree with Ms. Haas and Ms. Maisch: Shame on all of them. If 90% of the citizens in this country want a change in the gun laws, then 90% should be voting these spineless, ineffective so-called "representatives" of ours out of office.

I'm in my 60s and have been active in sports all of my life. I also happen to have arthritis and severe scoliosis, likely genetically linked considering my mother was a human pretzel the last decade of her life. I work hard to maintain my back and my joints and I am ecstatic that there are a variety of alternatives to living with and caving in to pain. I will continue to pursue all avenues that will keep me viable. Please don't minimize this problem. 
Sadness, yes; Her passing takes us back to that time and place when our whole lives were in front of us, limitless and golden. Ah, those blissful days! 
It's important for women to know they have a choice. And I wonder about any doctor performing a surgery knowing that there is perhaps another option for his/her patient that would be more effective. 
Furlough the Republican Congress. They don't want to work toward a solution? They shouldn't work at all. <br/><br/>See what it's like to lose your jobs rather than playing politics with the livelihood of others. Sickening. 
Correct, jwm; Bob from Ohio, there are many in Texas who are not of this ilk and who worked hard for area dems and the President. We fight on to make Texas blue. 
How did he get elected? He's from Texas, that's how. (Check out another Texas newcomer who is equally intransigent, arrogant, etc., DR. Donna Campbell.) With any luck, Cruz will go the way of the Siberian meteorite: Make a big boom, flash a big light, do some damage, and leave a big mess -- but quickly. A mess no one wants to have to clean up, but everybody is relieved is over. 
I was tested for celiac and do not have it but consider myself gluten-sensitive. That said, I am taking a common sense approach to my diet. I avoid wheat, processed foods, and fast food and I do feel much better. My diet, when consisting of fruits, vegetables, fish, chicken, and occasionally beef, prepared simply, is quite easy to follow and doesn't have to be boring. Yes, I occasionally fall off the wagon, crave a piece of bread or pasta, and I pay for it by not feeling well for a while.<br/>
One thing I found after spending considerable time reading the backs of gluten-free products: they aren't necessarily healthy. Many are high in sodium and fat. And after trying a few of them, well, many taste pretty bad.<br/>
My advice if you're going gluten-free: It's not rocket science. Get creative with herbs and spices. Check out some recipes. There are many new cookbooks that showcase gluten free dishes. Changing your diet takes some work, but it's worth it in the end.
Time to throw yourself on the sword, Mr. Boehner. You're on borrowed time, anyway because we the people are going to throw all of those bums out in due time. 
Thank you for this walk down memory lane. I remember the days of schmaltz and Mogen David very well. Heart disease decimated my parents' and grandparents' generations and my generation has learned to cook accordingly. Your adapted recipes are very much appreciated. Still, a couple times a year, we cheat; Hanukkah just isn't Hanukkah without real latkes, fried in oil. It's one dish that I just can't bear to make "healthy". 
Thank you for creating a series that doesn't focus on sex, every week, every plot. Not to sound like a prude (I'm not), but I'm glad my kids are grown and I don't have to explain to them that TV sitcoms today aren't a reflection of life because people don't spend every waking moment of their day embroiled in a (hilarious?) sexual situation. TV use was always monitored and limited on weeknights; today I'd be tempted just to turn it off. Hey, that's pretty much what I've come to do anyway.
"While they still help me out financially ... I got a full scholarship to college, so I don't think that's unreasonable." <br/><br/>"...without them ridiculously projecting their fears onto me as Ms. Engel does to her adult son."<br/><br/>"... cynical older people ..." <br/><br/>"Helicoptering is still a privilege reserved for upper class people ..." <br/><br/>Oh, sweetie ... I hope you have the opportunity to re-read your comments in, say, 20-30 years or so. By then your belief in your own entitlement and your judgmental attitude likely will be altered by the life experiences that those of us down the road know will be somewhat different than what you expect them to be.  
Of course she'd be the ultimate candidate but 'know what? She deserves to take a rest (and we do, too!) and tell the country in her own time what her plans are. In the meantime, we'd all be better served to take her advice: choose our cards, play them to the best of our abilities, and then move on to the next hand. 
I don't imagine I'll hear anything new or inspiring from either candidate. And when all the dust settles and political commentators have finished their tedious and ultimately worthless "analyzing," both sides will claim victory. Blah blah blah. 
Another Repub who didn't "divulge his plans" ...  Scott Walker. Yes, we should be VERY wary of politicians who don't divulge plans.
Paul Ryan popping up from a gopher hole ... that one's gonna carry me through the day! 
One advantage of Obama is that he sees the complexity of issues and is tender to BOTH sides rather than pushing forth with an agenda that only increases the polarity and rift.<br/>
We are not in the eighteenth century: either we hold to a self righteousness and 'racist' agenda that demonizes the opposition or we open with a more sophisticated approach that sees and speaks to the complexity.<br/>
Evidence of the richness of the Obama approach is seen in the convention: in the Republican, primarily white speaking of their deep values in one 'God' which is theirs (Israel-Christian right) and in the Democratic, a rich diversity speaking to the poor and outcast, to the complexity.<br/>
God guide America, God bless the world.
Just reflects many American's ignorance of those different from themselves.  Either you engage with respectfully or you retreat to a smaller view which is in danger of distortion.  The 'other' bears all the projections.  There is no 'righteous' nation nor group.  We are all in this together.  
No human being should take on having such definite opinions on such a wide array.<br/>
The word becomes constructed and hence without potency and priority.
How can one look at the photo attached to this article and not say that part of the solution is a redistribution of wealth?  It is complex but when you have a guy like B. not looking at his own excess (and in his case depravity) as part of the problem then will we ever get anywhere?
Tell me a story about a great person who was not a success.  This is such an 'easy' story.  Will we ever break out of the box?  'A Good Pakistani'.   We are so America-centric.  Find me a story of 'A Good Pakistani' outside of 'my world'.  Crazy. 
Capitalism evolves and has a life cycle.  We are seeing the separations of rich and poor and the accepted norm of deception that becomes necessary in both tight competition and in preserving the status quo as it grows.<br/>
With this comes a necessity for growth and in particular new markets.  I do not see most countries imperialistically expanding as the US.  Putin's comment is extreme yet contains some truth in labeling us as 'parasites'.  We are the best of countries and the worst in that our exports in the form of media and non-necessary goods that come in creating demand are excessive and disrupt cultures dividing them in two.  We never admit this truth but demonize those who are against the 'expansion'.  In a world where GNP and Purchasing Power put one country over another again we are shortsighted.  Having lived in the third world (be it Iran or Africa), I have come to know that THEY have the solution.  Instead, we litter the airwaves that place us over them in position of 'pity' and 'paternalism' and so miss the other side.<br/>
America's and many Christians support of 'Israel' as a nation on one level is important, yet if we are simply aligning privilege and blindness with privilege and blindness then we contribute to the terrible tone of injustice that rings in our ears and makes our steps heavy.
At the grocery store, the lines are long at night at the self-check station.  Some employees are stretched, others are scratching themselves and walking in circles in the opposite direction.<br/><br/>If and when the government slashes spending, jobs will be lost and there will be more standing in the self checkout line or others stretched or scratching themselves.  One problem: there is little incentive or reward for good performance.  Others: legal issues prevent.  Another problem: there are many other problems among tending to or going in the opposite direction scratching.  I see great people everywhere so I do not worry.  
I have lived in Africa as an American for a total of four years out of my last fifteen years.  I tire of the West's sole focus on the African tragedy depicted in the starving and the war torn.  While this scope is part of the truth, this tragedy is trumped by the aliveness and faithful found in the African people.<br/>
This should be a century where we turn to them for their wisdom and community building. 
If only we could control the world with drones!
We are a stupid and out of control people.<br/><br/>From Chuang Tzu speaking of Confucious: "The Yellow Emperor learns something about the nature of kingship from a boy tending to some horses: Governing the empire I suppose is not much different from herding horses. Get rid of whatever is harmful to the horsesthats all. 
We make the assumption that achievement and being pulled into the global market is a movement to greater human flourishing.  Maybe we could learn from some countrie's self-sufficient decentralized villages.  In approaching them for 'their knowledge', they are empowered and a greater relationship could be built.  I tire of pundits running away with words which in all honesty falls so short in capturing the complexity and uniqueness of every situation.
part of the path to peace is not the content of what we say but how we say it.
Of course there is a difference between Israel the state and Israel as 'hope'.  When I hear the word 'Israel' it is an Israel that embraces the outcast as in Ishmael and Esau.  Jesus points to God and was sacrificed between two others.  On one level, we should support the state Israel, encourage it to use its advantage and strength wisely (parallel to US).  In another, we should encourage what 'Israel' has stood for 'spiritually', a people always fluid and concerned for justice and the outcast.
This is a country where the majority do not have the wisdom to understand ways to peace that are sustained and important.
Obama is going to run rings around a GOP-dominated House. The GOP have no plan except to bring Obama down. But as they showed in their open debate with him last year when they let the cameras into their sparring with Obama, they are no match for him. Now that Obama has a GOP House to fight with, they'll suffer by comparison. He's going to look like the great conciliator, and they'll look like the great obstructionists.<br /><br />Watch the GOP misstep time and again in 2011. Obama is a shoe-in for a second term. One wishes that his inevitable re-election opens a challenge from the left, to maybe scare him out of his Blue Dog propensities into being a real progressive, which is what the country needs and hasn't had since ... well, since Eisenhower.
Unfortunately, there can be no meeting ground in our current politics. The two opposing sides are now so distant from each other, each believe the other is evil. Yes, evil. Many liberals think Bush did evil things -- war with Iraq, lying, torture. Many conservatives think Obama is evil: a socialist whose tyrannical government is taking away their liberties. That's where we stand -- in Manichean opposition.<br /><br />Meanwhile, our real problems -- education, unemployment (22% if counted correctly), loss of manufacturing capability, crumbling infrastructure, planet-damaging energy use, personal and national debt -- all remain unsolved. Our political system is inadequate to our challenges. As bad as things are, they will have to get a whole lot worse before we come to our senses.<br /><br />Our leaders -- our elite -- are so removed by privilege from the lives of regular Americans, they have no idea what is going on, and hence, no real empathy for what the average American has to contend with. They can neither see nor feel outside their bubble.<br /><br />These two polarities -- between our two parties (Dems and Reps) and between our two classes (the top 1% elite who runs things and average Americans) -- are at present utterly unbridgeable. If an amazingly bright and seemingly sensible and willing-to-compromise fellow like President Obama can't make much of a difference, who can? Who will?<br /><br />We will only change when we start hitting rock-bottom, and we still have half the way to go. It will take another decade for us to get there. Meanwhile, fasten your seatbelts: it's going to be a mighty rocky ride.
The sad, sad thing is that Obama has not only let himself and his party down: he has let his country down.<br /><br />He is setting himself up for losing in 2012. Our economy will not have recovered by then -- and the GOP will blame Obama, and his feckless record will quite properly count against him. Then the GOP will take over completely, and we'll be in for another Bush/Cheney-like disaster.<br /><br />I cannot believe that it took Obama, evidently a smart man, only two years to throw away a winning hand -- to the point that he is now capitulating to the Republicans on such a clear-cut issue.<br /><br />I don't blame the Democratic Party for this mess. Nancy Pelosi has led a perfectly progressive House, and the Senate Dems have had the filibuster against them.<br /><br />I blame Obama. His playing-to-the-middle instead of to his progressive base has doomed his Presidency. He has stabbed his base in the heart. The progressives who worked to make him President will not work for him again. The disappointment is too deep; all hope for real change from him is now dead. With this last capitulation, Obama has shoveled the final soil onto his own coffin.<br /><br />Let's face it: his messaging has been terrible because he never had a governing message. He has simply engineered a series of hapless ad-hoc compromises with his enemies, and bleated out hapless ad-hoc excuses for his compromises.<br /><br />Very sad for him, for his party, and for us.<br /><br />Let's hope that some day a real progressive will lead the Democratic Party and make some real changes. And let's hope we never again make the mistake of voting for a fake progressive.
GOP obstructionism works. It helped keep America screwed-up these last two years, so the GOP could blame the Dems for everything wrong, and get the votes they needed to  take over the House.<br /><br />It will work again for them in the next two years. With their House majority, the GOP can now make damn sure nothing good will happen for our country, and then they can blame Obama for everything wrong, and replace him with Mitt Romney (or even Sarah Palin).<br /><br />The worse they make things for everyone else, the better for them. What a terrible irony.
Campaigner Obama put himself forward as a progressive new-comer, but as President turned out to be an old-style backroom deal-making politician, with no core of his own. It was all a sham. He's a pragmatist all right, which means he stands for nothing. There's a fine line between having no principles and being unprincipled, and Obama skirts it.<br /><br />We have to look elsewhere for a truly change-agent president -- Howard Dean, Alan Grayson, Russ Feingold. The soul of the Democratic Party -- the progressive left -- has to take over the Democratic Party, just as the Tea Party is taking over the GOP. The time has come for class warfare against the plutocracy that is disgracing our democracy.
Without the government, we wouldn't have had the internet.<br /><br />And currently, with employer-based and for-profit healthcare, American private enterprise is made less competitive versus other nations.<br /><br />Without government funding of green energy, we'll never get the private-enterprise green energy businesses we need. China outcompetes us because its government subsidizes those businesses that need to be subsidized, like green energy.<br /><br />We subsidize the oil business and agribusiness to our detriment. The whole GOP Conservative anti-nanny state tradition is simply code for "hey, we rich people don't want our taxes spent on poor people." Meanwhile, we have corporate welfare like there's no tomorrow. The conservatives would be intellectual honest if they stopped giving out corporate welfare and stopped complaining about regular folks being helped by government.  They want our taxes spent on helping rich people instead of poor and middle-class folks. That's what the mean when they bang on about "personal responsibility."<br /><br />We're beyond being a nanny state anyway. 38% of our GDP comes from federal and state enterprise. That train left the station years ago. Now the problem is: should our taxes be used to stimulate job-creating businesses and retirement security -- or Wall Street gambling?<br /><br />The conservative tradition stands for income inequality and nothing else.
I once taught for two weeks in the Bronx, to 14-year-olds. One of my two classes was so unruly they were unteachable. Granted I was a novice, but at one point I stood with a master teacher in a sea of chaos, and she whispered to me, "sometimes you just have to wait for them to come to their senses." I thought to myself, you're my role model?<br /><br />The kids would only "come to their senses" if I called on the help of a cop, who could cower them to silence. The few times I did manage to engage with these kids, it was obvious that they were bright and talented, but that there was nobody who cared for them. The five students out of a class of 32 who were attentive and did the work, had to struggle against constant noise and indifference.<br /><br />Yes, it will require heroic efforts to save black youth. But more than that, it will require heroic amounts of money, and this will never be forthcoming, We will continue to warehouse these kids through school and send them out into the world ill-prepared for anything but the acting out of their personal traumas.<br /><br />We'd rather spend our money going overseas to kill foreign Muslims than spend it on saving Americans at home.<br /><br />That's the way it is, and that's the way it will be. After all, poor folks don't vote, only middle-class people do.
They say a rising tide lifts all yachts. Maybe the rising voices of the people will sink them.
The changes that Tom Friedman mentions aren't going to happen. Nor will the most necessary change of all --  a massive public works program that could employ millions to build and repair our infrastructure (smart grid, high-speed rail, broadband, big tax breaks to green-energy start-ups and folks who green-energize their homes, etc),<br /><br />The corporate stranglehold over the nation's future will continue -- the fat cats of Wall Street, Big Oil, Big Agribusiness, Big Pharma, Big-Bonus-and-Golden-Parachute CEOs, the Big Military Industrial Complex. We on Main Street will remain the willing Stockholm Syndrome dupes of the Washington-Wall Street-Pentagon Axis of Predatory Fraudsters.<br /><br />Let's face it, this is what America is. This is what America has become. This is what America will be. There will be no Poor People's Movement. No Pitchfork Uprising. No massive Middle-Class March. No national demand for the reining in of our plutocrats. No nationwide insistence on holding them accountable for ripping us off, legally and illegally. The revolution will not be televised because the revolution will never happen, One cannot get a nation of obese potatoes off the couch and into the streets. They're happier vegetating on their behinds in front of the TV machine's 24/7 propaganda.<br /><br />It doesn't matter which political party is in power: the fleecing of regular folk by our morally blind elites will continue. Our elites enter into their bubble at our Ivy League universities, and they never exit this bubble. They don't have to. Life is good in their bubble. Outside the bubble, Main Street dreams turn into Pain Street ashes.<br /><br />The Tea Party folks -- our latest populist movement -- are complaining about big spending. They are right to do so. But here's the weird thing. While they may vent about the big spending on social services (healthcare, Medicare, and Social Security, which is solvent, BTW), there's not a single peep out of them about our Godzilla-sized military spending.<br /><br />America is looking more and more like Rome under Nero. And what do the Tea Party people do about this trend? While we're burning and our elites are fiddling, they're complaining about the quality of the firewood.<br /><br />The decline of America will only be arrested if the greed of our elites consumes all reason, and renders our entire middle class totally desperate or jobless. Will our elites be that dumb? Possibly. Meanwhile, see you at the next financial meltdown. And get used to it -- meltdowns have been, and will continue to be, our traditional way of life.<br />    
Despite our President wanting to build a smart grid, and despite a growing number of Americans being aware of the ultimate cost of climate change, we in America are going to be watching Europe and China beat us in the green energy game. Our political system is too dysfunctional, and too beholden to Big Oil.<br /><br />Four out of the five biggest companies by revenue in the world are oil companies, and three of them are American. Until we find a way to make it worthwhile for those oil companies to incorporate green energy in their energy mix, we can forget about catching up with other countries who are already well ahead of us.<br /><br />We seem to prefer to spend our taxes on our military and on corporate welfare and on Wall Street -- the very same entities who are responsible for our decline. And we neglect our infrastructure and public school system.<br /><br />Maybe regular Americans have become natural and docile victims of our elite, suffering from Stockholm Syndrome. Either that, or we are so uninformed as to be the dumbest nation on earth. I don't know which is worse. I hope there is another explanation, as well as a workable solution.  Maybe the smart readers of the New York Times have explanations and solutions at hand.  
Kemo:<br />Yes, great does depend on definition. Let's start with the Beatles and Bob Dylan. Then we might diverge. I think Captain Beefheart and Van Morrison and Frank Zappa are greats, but they haven't sold as many records as AC/DC or Garth Brooks, whom I don't think are great, but millions would say are great. The Arcade Fire people have not released enough records to quality for greatness, even if they are, which I don't see them attaining. They seem to me a more simple-minded Radiohead. If you compare them to the art rock of the 70s, whom they compare themselves to, they don't at this moment hold a candle to Roxy Music or Genesis or Yes or Emerson Lake and Palmer. They go for the same bombast, but one misses the ingenuity of the original art rock bands. But that is just my opinion, and I may be proved wrong. Let's hope. I don't see much in contemporary rock that's all that interesting. At least Lady Gaga has come up with four excellent songs so far, which is more than Madonna had after two albums, and Madonna doesn't even write her own melodies like Gaga does. There's a reason there are so many versions by amateurs of Lady Gaga songs on YouTube: they're unbelievably catchy -- a catchy hook is the first job of any good songwriter. That's why Lennon/McCartney are up there with Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, the Gershwins, etc -- they wrote more catchy hooks than anyone else.
Kemo:<br />I love Aracade Fire, too, though they're certainly not among the greats. What we have here is a difference of taste,not of intellect. You acquired your taste for Arcade Fire via the media too. Their PR machine is aimed at intellectual snobs and hipsters, while Lady Gaga's machine is aimed at disaffected club youth. There's room for both in my eclectic universe, and not in yours.So be it. But you don't have to get all snooty about it, dude (or dudette). 
Lady Gaga is the lady of the moment, and will continue to be so. She's wicked smart the way she constructed her persona, in the same way that Bowie constructed his, and MJ did, and Madonna did. Every time someone makes fun of her or writes her off, they create more fans for her. Plus, she writes her own melodies, which Madonna never had the talent to do. Lady Gaga is going to be around for a long, long time, because she's an an excellent songwriter, a cultural force, and a really smart cookie. Get used to it.
It is a great pity that many on America's Religious Right have forgotten the infinite demand that love makes, and have exchanged it for the rather limitless demands that hate can also make. Their homophobia is a case in point. One would hope that sooner rather than later, this will change -- perhaps when the Pat Robertsons have gone, and the hate fades, and is replaced by love again. 
When Obama plays for the middle of the middle that he likes so much, he is not aiming for the center, but for the right. The GOP has moved us over so far to the right, nobody knows where the center is anymore.<br /><br />It is a sign of the times that Obama has a Trojan Horse going called the Deficit Commission. Is he really going to start attacking Social Security now? Something that Bush Two tried to do and miserably flopped at? I never thought I'd live to see the day that a Democratic president would fall so hard for a GOP canard of cutting the deficit on the backs of the poor -- instead of pushing really hard for raising the top marginal rate from its paltry 35% (it was over 90% under Eisenhower) to 50% plus, or for Tobin-taxing Wall Street, or for making sure that tax loopholes do not allow giant corporations like Goldman Sachs to get away with paying a tax rate of 1% like they did in 2007.<br /><br />Are we all so bamboozled that even Democrats fall for this "attacking entitlements" nonsense? If we are, we may never get out of the Great American Ditch dug for us by Reagan, Bush Two, Bill Clinton (who signed the repeal of Glass-Steagall that let "too big to fail" Citigroup exist, and signed a bill that freed derivatives trading from all constraints), Bush-Cheney (when government folks in charge of overseeing permits to Big Oil had sex-and-coke parties with them), and Obama (who gave passes to financial terrorists like Goldman Sachs and environmental terrorists like BP).<br /><br />Here's the salient fact to bear in mind: our Ivy League elites have rolled back FDR's revolution to the point that today, the bottom 80% of Americans have to make do with 15% of the incredibly shrinking American pie.<br /><br />Obama, wake up! You've got Stockholm Syndrome! Start recognizing your enemies! Come back to your friends!
The GOP have driven us into a ditch so deep there is no getting out. Even if Obama the President started acting like Obama the Candidate, we would not get out.<br /><br />The deregulation-and-tax-cuts-for-the-rich ditch was first dug by Ronald Reagan. The first meltdown since the Great Depression was the S &amp; L crisis that started on his watch. Before Reagan the top marginal tax rate was 60% under Carter, having come down from over 90% under Eisenhower. In those days you could work for General Motors all your life, afford a home and retire with dignity, on one salary.<br /><br />Reagan cut that rate down to 28% in 1981. Bush One continued Reagan's voodoo economics, and Bill Clinton, despite a budget surplus, continued the ditch-digging by signing two bills that (a) repealed Glass-Steagall (and allowed "too big to fail" Citigroup to exist), and (b) freed derivatives trading of all constraints. Under Bush-Cheney the gloves came off completely, and the folks in charge of overseeing permits for Big Oil had sex-and-coke parties with them. Under Obama our financial terrorists like Goldman Sachs and our environmental terrorists like BP still have a free hand.<br /><br />Today the top marginal tax rate is 35% and the bottom 80% of Americans have to make do with 15% of the incredibly shrinking American pie.<br /><br />Our entitled Ivy League elites have sunk us all. We will NEVER get out of this ditch, because by now enough of us -- independents, Fox News viewers, Tea Party people, Blue Dogs, the MSM, Congress, the New York Times -- have a permanent case of Stockholm Syndrome. Our fourth estate acts as the 24/7 enablers of this syndrome.<br /><br />It took our elites just three decades to reverse FDR's policies and to dig the Great American Ditch, which has now become the grave of the American Dream.<br /><br />It will be up to our children to dig us out. Here's hoping enough of us teach our kids the basic decency of sharing -- so the next generation can grow up with the moral backbone to reclaim the American Dream.
Spare us, Mr. Brooks. This was a Special Ops guy surrounded by his buddies who was screwing up a mission that was all too easy to screw up.<br /><br />Back when the Pentagon rolled Obama against the wishes of Joe Biden, Obama decided that he'd go for a surge, and get out after 18 months -- a perfect Obaman compromise: we'll surge because that's what you Generals want, and then we'll get out because that's what we need to do politically -- so I, Obama, can get re-elected.<br /><br />Then Obama went round the table and asked them each one, all the generals and the pols and Ambassador and Special Envoy: "You may not agree with what we've decided to do, but will you execute?" And they all said yes.<br /><br />McCrystal didn't execute, plain and simple. This guy who covered up the fragging of Pat Tillman and told the aggrieved family to go jump in the lake, he was already skating on thin ice. Then he screwed up. He all of a sudden didn't think the mission would succeed. Of course we all know it won't, but his job was to execute and see what he could do in 18 months before the drawdown. When he figured this job was too tough to handle, he started behaving like he was the mission, and not Team Obama.<br /><br />Well, Obama is now in whip-cracking mode -- witness BP having to toe the line or else. McCrystal wasn't even given a chance to go clear his desk in Afghanistan. They boxed his stuff and sent it back for him to sort through in the humiliation he so richly deserves.<br /><br />Mr. Brooks, you often have great insight -- bohos and all -- but sometimes your conservative bias leads you to take a wild shot at some cultural shift which may or may not apply. In this case -- the firing of a general who did not execute on a promise he made his boss -- you are firing with blanks.<br /><br />Adam Ash
Supreme Court, have you no shame?<br /><br />McCathyism is back.<br /><br />By this law, any and all environmental activists can end up in jail.

The fact that the marriage between Obama and Americans has soured has a lot to do with how the marriage between Obama and reporters has soured -- and especially how there was neither a courtship nor an engagement between Obama and Fox News.<br /><br />For example, it's strange that even the commentariat on the left are not hailing Obama's accomplishment -- to get the fourth biggest corporation in the world to ante up a down payment of $20 billion over the next few years, administered by a 3rd party to compensate their victims quickly -- as one of the most remarkable presidential achievements of modern times. I don't remember anything like that happening with Bhopal and Exxon Valdez. I don't remember Reagan, the Bushes, Carter or Clinton doing anything remotely as effective for us regular folks.<br /><br />What are the chattering classes doing instead? They are banging on about Obama's "disappointing" Oval Office speech, and the fact that he is not playing the Drama Queen-in-Chief in this BP tragedy. Our punditocrats prefer theatrics to real-world performance. The posturing of the 4th estate around this disaster is on the same continuum of tastelessness as Joe Barton's apology to BP. And THAT has a lot to do with how Americans perceive Obama, because they're looking at him through MSM goggles.<br /><br />If one takes off those goggles, admittedly a near-nigh impossible task, one may see him differently. Like I do on the $20 billion issue.<br /><br />Thank you, President Obama. You may have let down progressives on many issues (you are not the change I voted for in 2008), but this was a remarkable achievement. On behalf of all the "small people" I thank you from the bottom of my heart. Your action has made this American heart swell a little bigger.<br /><br />Adam Ash
Obama's big mistake was appointing Geithner and Summers as his economic team. There were others to choose from: Joseph Stiglitz springs to mind. One assumes that was what Obama wanted: to save Wall Street at our expense. His rhetoric against the banksters was not backed by firm action against them.<br /><br />His second big mistake was that, after saying we needed a public option to "keep the insurance industry honest," he did not, when the chips were down, give the impression that he was fighting to keep the public option alive.<br /><br />Keeping Guantanamo open and extraordinary rendition and indefinite detention going, and increasing troop levels in Afghanistan have also been factors to add to progressive disappointment, but I think mollycoddling Wall Street and not fighting tooth and nail for the public option were his big mistakes.<br /><br />Obama will still be a better president than all of the more recent ones from Reagan on (the competition is not formidable), but unless he launches us into a real green energy future, he will not be remembered as a great president. Which will be a pity, because he has it in him to be that.<br /><br />Perhaps the challenges have been too great for a him and his team to rise to. But FDR had bigger challenges, and rose to them (he also had more than two terms). Obama is undoubtedly the best man for the job. And if re-elected, he has many more years to go. For the sake of our much-imperiled nation, one hopes he grows to greatness in the job.<br /><br />Adam Ash

Obama lost me long before he let Congress craft a healthcare bill that killed the public option. What is he prepared to fight for? His half-baked policies give the impression that he isn't even prepared to fight for his re-election.<br /><br />Obama lost me NOT when he made a deal with Big Pharma to ban importation of cheaper drugs. He lost me NOT when said the public option was not essential to a healthcare bill. He lost me NOT when he said he wanted to find savings in Medicare, which nevertheless scared me.<br /><br />Obama lost me when he said "We shouldn't be tilting at windmills here" about going after the fat cat bankers of Wall Street. Then he worked with the fat cats to craft legislation in June last year that left derivatives largely unregulated and did not rein in the banks on bonuses or leverage -- allowing Wall Street to coin it in 2009 while Main Street is still suffering. We bailed out the banksters, and they used our money to position themselves for huge bonuses. An adder digesting a rodent has more shame about its prey than today's Wall Street has about the rest of us.<br /><br />More than Obama's wobbliness on healthcare, more than his sell-out to Big Pharma, more than his stepping up the war in Afghanistan even, his comity with the fat cat bankers who ruined our economy and threw 100 million people all over the world out of work and into hunger -- that's what sticks in this progressive's throat. Meanwhile, the Fed floods the banksters with cheap money: essentially printing their profits for them.<br /><br />Do us regular folks who suffer because of Wall Street cosmic incompetence get a break? No. Here's a nicely odious but appropriate analogy: a court, faced with the crime of a homicidal maniac, picks out his next victims for him and delivers them to him all trussed up.<br /><br />Wall Street decimated us, and Obama has let them keep the tools with which they did it -- so they can do it again. Yes, caving on healthcare is terrible, but letting the destroyers of millions of livelihoods not only get away with it, but making sure they can do it again -- that is unforgivable.<br /><br />I am hoping for a credible and charismatic champion of the left to take Obama down in the 2012 primary, or at least force him to explain himself and change his triangulating ways.<br /><br />I loved Obama the candidate; I despair in Obama the president.<br /><br />Because if Obama doesn't change, the next Republican President will take us further down the Reagan-Clinton-Bush creek and over the fall onto the rocks of a failed state.

@Ron: If I remember correctly, the healthcare law was passed without a SINGLE republican vote. The democrats could have made the law ANYTHING they wanted it to be. And you blame the republicans for a lack of a single payer system? The democratic party didn't even have enough support within their own party for a "public option!" <br/><br/>Sheesh!
OK, so a product costs $400 in 2013. A new government program begins that will affect the cost of that product. It is predicted that the new product will cost $600 in 2014. <br/><br/>WAIT, the new product will "only" cost $500 in 2014, "LOWER THAN PREDICTED." <br/><br/>What great news! Thanks US government. <br/><br/>I mean really? Are you kidding me? Who cares that the cost is lower than predicted? Does it cost MORE than before the PPACA was passed? <br/><br/>All one has to do is read the CMS reports from 2010 and 2013. "Obamacare" will increase health care costs. (by $621 BILLION over the next ten years) Between 2015-2022 the cost curve bends up!<br/><br/>This is the signature legislation from a president who explained that we need this law, "because the rising cost of healthcare was creating an unsustainable burden on the taxpayer."<br/><br/>It is almost beyond belief. And the NY Times is complicit with this puff piece masquerading as news. 
This argument is BEYOND silly. It completely ignores how our government works. The members of congress were elected specifically because they DON'T agree with Obama/Liberal policies like Obamacare. So, Congress should just roll over and give the President what he wants. Absolutely ridiculous. 
Except that the President stated that "The rising cost of health care was creating an unsustainable burden on the taxpayer." This country can not afford Medicare in its present form. We are sitting on a demographic time bomb with the baby boomers retiring. <br/><br/>Additionally, I believe the President has set back the cause of single payer by a generation. The democrats passed the ACA on a single party vote. The democrats didn't even have enough support in their own party for a "Public Option!"<br/><br/>The people who keep talking about "Single payer" in the comments section seem to reside in fantasy land! 
unfortunately, this debacle of a law, which was sold to the public based on some blatant lies; has set back the cause of single payer for a generation!
The revisionist history is a thing to behold.<br/>|<br/><a href="http://www.davidstuff.com/political/wmdquotes.htm" title="http://www.davidstuff.com/political/wmdquotes.htm" target="_blank">http://www.davidstuff.com/political/wmdquotes.htm</a><br/><br/>Also, let's not forget that Hussein used chemical weapons against his own people as well. 
would love to see the data or polls that support the Democrats re-taking the house. This seems like nothing but wishful thinking on "Philster's" part.  "Quite possibly?" Based on what?
How silly to blame the republicans. The truth is that the American public does NOT support any type of military action on a BIPARTISAN basis. Congress represents their constituents. The constituents don't want this war. But "J"  sees fit to blame the republicans. Is their hypocrisy on the part of republican politicians? No more than their is for the Democratic politicians who were anti war and could have cared less that Saddam Hussein used gas on the Kurds in Iraq. 
"Republicans" created the slower recovery! That is rich. after 5 years of the Obama presidency and Trillions in Keynesian stimulus. 
RealTruth lives in a fantasy world where the PPACA is BOOSTING EMPLOYMENT! LOL!!!
You call yourself "RealTruth" and yet claim that Obamacare is creating jobs and boosting full time employment? Why not see what (Far right wing ;-)  ) Union leader for the Teamsters, James Hoffa says about that?<br/><br/><a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2013/07/12/union-letter-obamacare-will-destroy-the-very-health-and-wellbeing-of-workers/" title="http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2013/07/12/union-letter-obamacare-will-destroy-the-very-health-and-wellbeing-of-workers/" target="_blank">http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2013/07/12/union-letter-obam...</a><br/><br/>"First, the law creates an incentive for employers to keep employees work hours below 30 hours a week. Numerous employers have begun to cut workers hours to avoid this obligation, and many of them are doing so openly. The impact is two-fold: fewer hours means less pay while also losing our current health benefits."<br/><br/>"the ACA will shatter not only our hard-earned health benefits, but destroy the foundation of the 40 hour work week that is the backbone of the American middle class."<br/><br/>BOOSTING EMPLOYMENT? Shame on you!
Short term gains for the wealthy are a byproduct of this policy. Don't you see what is going on here? This is all done for political reasons. This was all about the election in 2012 and going forward in 2014. If the Fed pulled back and people realized just how bad things are. Do you think Obama and the Obama sychophants would be re-elected? WAKE UP!
So true. And the majority of the readers here will support Hillary in 2016. <br/><br/>"In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including al Qaeda members ... It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons."<br/>-- Sen. Hillary Clinton (D, NY), Oct 10, 2002
Yawn... The predictable call for a single payer from the automaton crowd. Unfortunately, the PPACA was so poorly drafted that it did not address the KEY issue of cost control. Within a month of the laws signing the Medicare actuary (in what the NY Times called a "detailed and rigorous analysis of the law) determined that the new law would INCREASE health care costs, not lower them. <br/><br/>Of course prior to the laws passage, the President stated that "the rising cost of health care was creating an unsustainable burden on the taxpayer!"<br/><br/>The constant promised of Obama, Pelosi et al of cost control, job creation and being able to keep your plan; will turn out to be untrue for MILLIONS of Americans. <br/><br/>The Democrats have damaged the cause of single payer for a generation to come!
Because people like you don't bother to look! There are so many great alternatives out there. <br/><br/><a href="http://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/how-to-replace-obamacare" title="http://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/how-to-replace-obamacare" target="_blank">http://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/how-to-replace-obamacare</a>
SPOT ON!<br/><br/>The reason why medicare and Social Security were so popular is that EVERYONE paid in and everyone got a benefit back. This is a system that disrupts the entire system for 10% of the population. There were better ways to do this, but the Democrats would not be stopped. <br/><br/>I urge EVERYONE who cares about this issue and this horrific law to read this piece.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/how-to-replace-obamacare" title="http://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/how-to-replace-obamacare" target="_blank">http://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/how-to-replace-obamacare</a>
What planet do you live on? The democrats owned this law. They passed it without a single republican vote. If single payer was wildly popular within the democratic party; the new law would have been a single payer system! There was not even support within the democratic party for a "public option!"<br/><br/>This governmental debacle that is obamacare will have set back the goal of a single payer system by a generation. After this disaster that will CLEARLY not do as promised; do you believe the public will embrace a government health care system? <br/><br/>SHEESH!
@common Sense:<br/><br/>You are quiet a piece of work! There wasn't even enough support in the Democratic party to pass a public option. <br/><br/>We must pass health care reform that will work and that is a POLITICAL POSSIBILITY. <br/><br/>At this point in our countries history; single payer health care is a pipe dream. As a matter of fact, the DISASTER that is Obamacare has set back the goal of a single payer system by a generation. <br/><br/>What a debacle!
Posts like these make me laugh. There was not even enough support within the Democratic party for a public option and you are talking about "single payer."<br/><br/>By selling this law on a pack of lies; The President and the Democrats have done harm to the cause of single payer. They have set back the cause by a generation. 
Unfortunately, with this government run debacle, The democrats have set back the cause of single payer health care for a generation!
This type of post makes me laugh. A law is rolled out that is a MASSIVE governmental program. It clearly will NOT do all the things that it was promised to do! And then again and again people claim.... "Single payer is the way to go."<br/><br/>While I agree with that statement; this particular law will have set back the cause of TRUE single payer/governmental health care by a generation!
Unfortunately, this law was so poorly drafted and passed against the wishes of the majority of americans; that it will probably set back the cause of single payer for a generation!
It is clear that this law was sold to the public on a pack of lies! How refreshing it would have been to have seen an HONEST selling of the law. Americans, covering the uninsured is a moral imperative! Some of you will see cost savings, but others will see their costs INCREASE. But, this is part of the social contract as we attempt to make sure that all americans have access to medical care!<br/><br/>Instead, we were told that the law would lower costs for EVERYONE! We were told that if you like your plan, you can keep it, period! We were told that the law would be great for business. Nancy told us that it would create 4,000,000 jobs, almost 400,000 of those jobs immediately. <br/><br/>This law is so bad and so unpopular that I fear the democrats have set back the cause of a SINGLE PAYER system for at least a generation! <br/><br/>Is there anyone here who really believes that costs will not continue to skyrocket and that it won't cause the long term debt and our deficit to balloon?<br/><br/>Democrats would be better off to distance themselves from this law. There are already so many negative stories that it is going to impact the 2014 midterms. If the Republicans take back the Senate. The party of NO will quickly become the democrats and the President will become President Veto. The democrats will be in a position where all they are doing is "obstructing."<br/><br/>When both private and public sector unions come out with SCATHING letters railing against the law; you know you are in trouble. 
Bill, I left the Republican party this year because it has become a "know-nothing" and thoughtless flat-world circle of true believers.  Yes, I can see why Joe the Plumber would be appealing to you --- a phoney tripping through life avoiding regulations, avoiding paying his share of taxes, and seeking his 15 minutes of fame by posing as something he isn't.  What an American hero!<br /><br />McCain's all-consuming search for the presidency has created a pathetic figure who wants to appear to be all things to all people, but has produced a campaign that resounds through a hollow echo chamber that is full of sound and fury and signifies nothing.
The Republican party has become a haven for reactionaries, the "know-nothings," the flat-world society, the neo-cons, and a steadily declining number of hard-core supporters.  Over the last eight years the Republicans have proved to be incapable of governing in a manner that benefits Americans.  Today it rants and raves and still cannot focus on the issues before us.  Until the party can come to grips with the reality that it is a party of the few for the few, it has lost its right to govern.  Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt, and even Ronald Reagan would be ashamed of what the party has become.<br /><br />This, from a former Republican and now avowed independent.
What a novel idea to start talking to your friends and perhaps, even your enemies.  Perhaps some administration will come along and recognize that we don't have to bully everyone on the block and that America does have a realistic moral position that does not require us to look down our noses at everyone else. Hmmm.  I wonder which would be better:  Obama or McCain?<br /><br />That sure is a no-brainer! 
Palin, by flailing around with her one-sided message, does nothing more than echo the narrow dreams of a reactionary side of America.  She seems to be a part of a declining minority, but God help us all if she ever becomes part of the majority! 
When scripted, Palin can perform fairly well as a talking head --- but, where is the substance?  It just isn't there.
If anything, this adds an additional negative to that long-sought after legacy that the Bush administration has been vainly searching for.<br /><br />However, the now McCain led republicans certainly seem to wish a return to the Hoover era and apparently will welcome a depression/recession.<br /><br />It is time to get some people in Congress that represent something other than the Bush/McCain kind of friends and someone in the White House who represents something other than a Chicken Little style of administration.
So the GOP intends to repeat the Hoover-era blunders.  Great Depression, here we come with Geezer and Gidget to help them along.  Who said history will never repeat itself?
What I see in McCain and Palin is a rigidity of thought that precludes any ability to be flexible and adjust to changing situations.  That was apparent in the "debate" last night and in the Palin comments.<br /><br />McCain reminds me of the generals in WWI that kept ordering their troops to charge an entrenched foe with barbed wire and machine guns, believing that one more effort would win the day.  Palin is just mindless and capable of saying nothing more than the few talking points which she incoherently attempts to repeat.<br /><br />I would not want either one of them close to that red button and I would hope that the American electorate can come to grips with more than abortion as an issue, or we are going to suffer more of the same old same-o!
We are going on eight years of having incompetent and selfish "leadership."  And, if the narrow-minded and bigoted have their way, we can enjoy some more similar years.<br /><br />I am wondering what it would be like to have someone leading this country that listens, has some orginal thoughts, exhibits empathy, and has read something other than his own book.
I am shocked, absolutely shocked.<br /><br />Does this mean that everything that we have heard from the White House has been a lie?<br /><br />I am shocked, utterly shocked.
In the parlance of the best comparison that can be made for the Bush administration, "This is a fine kettle of  fish that you have gotten us into!"<br /><br />Anyone for another Laurel and Hardy administration?
"Nobody ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American public."<br /><br />H.L. Mencken
Do you realize how many of the king's men and king's horses are necessary to prop up the humpty-dumpty candidacy of McCain and Palin?<br /><br />...and they still keep falling off the wall.
Sounds to me that she carefully follows the script set forward by Dubya and his manipulative vice president.  My God, haven't we learned our lesson, or are we doomed to repeat history?<br /><br />I wonder what kind of a role the first dude will have in any administration that she is a part of?  Maybe he will just collect per diem, who knows?
Now we know why Palin was kept away from the media:<br /><br />Lightweight, INexperienced, and pedantic.  My God, how many weeks has it taken to get her this far and memorize the lines she has to deliver.<br /><br />Now that, my friends, is a pig in a poke!
Geezer and Gidget, America's least known media interviewees.  Hey, America, we will be anything you want up through election day.  You people love a pig in a poke and we want to bring you as much mystery and/or misery as you can take.  It's worked for the last eight years, so why not once again?
If McCain was sincere about eliminating rancor, he should have picked a more moderate spokesperson than Mrs. Attila the Hun.  Gun-toting, right-wing, holier-than-thou, flat-world society, anti-environmentalists certainly do not promote the idea of bipartisanship.  Maybe he means to change his spots after the election --but which way? 
I would give Mr. McCain some credence if he was not so deeply in bed with the Bush handlers, the neocons, plus all of those that are so much identified with failed policies.  He is going to have a hard time convincing me that he wants to be above the fray when his attack dogs are being unleashed.<br /><br />Right now, McCain represents hypocrisy at its worst.
Pregnancy issue:  Not relevant<br /><br />Vetting issue:  Significant<br /><br />McCain's role:  Disturbing<br /><br />Palin's background:  Even more disturbing<br /><br />The GOP:  Too emotional and at a loss to be critical<br /><br />
It is unfortunate that such an event occurred, but it does give pause to the level of hypocrisy that is evident in the evangelical community.  Pastors who have been adulterous, church leadership that have misused funds, and church membership that preaches one thing and does another.<br /><br />America deserves better.

Instructions:<br /><br />1.  Look like a leader.<br /><br />2.  Get pictures taken as often as possible.<br /><br />3.  Don't get in way of people doing the real work.<br /><br />4.

Suggest a lot of prayer.<br /><br />8.  Have them take a lot more pictures.<br /><br />9.  Refrain from looking overjoyed with Bush-Cheyney not attending the convention.<br /><br />10. Take more pictures.
If anything, the Russian reaction has clearly pointed out that the Bush administration's bullying, sermonizing, inability to learn, and incapability of listening has been an utter failure and little Johnny McSame wants to follow in the same footsteps.  It is so hard for the US to even suggest a moral position, when it has abandoned its higher ground.<br /><br />It seems that the only consistency left with this bankrupt administration is an insatiable desire to start World War III.  What a legacy!

The language one hears in even the most expensive seats of Madison Garden is appalling,  I would not take my children to see a hockey game in New York.
He viewed it as an unfortunate but necessary part of the process to making things right, said Nathan J. Hochman, a lawyer for Mr. Shaw.<br/>Yes,... make things right, for his client. 
a real woman! and a far cry from the Justin Bieber's of today's world
'Agribusiness lawyers' is the second vermin problem in this stale tale which smells bad even across the ocean. The first real vermin problem is agribusiness.
He is a ruthless cheat and an even more ruthless liar who tried to destroy a few people around him in order to cover-up his cheating and lying, and that's only part of it. They would be crazy to let him race again, it would be a complete dishonor to every clean athlete, amateur or professional.
Let's face it: We are a country of hucksters and fakes, but that said, it has been part of our culture, for better or for worse, for a very long time. Fortunately, it isn't all of who we are and, to be fair, its been part of human culture since forever. America's chase for the almighty dollar brings out the best of us but also the very worst. The internet is just the latest tool to scam others. Like the old adage: "If there weren't suckers in the market place there wouldn't be cracked wares".<br/>
What is sad, it seems to me is that it has become too ingrained in our thinking that its OK to lie and cheat. (Think of the Irak war). Our propensity to cheat comes up from the bottom but drops also from the top echelons of our society. When the unacceptable becomes acceptable we lose our integrity and we lose our souls.
Now, maybe they let all those poor people out of so many prisons everywhere. They are usually those who languish in jail because they didn't have the means to pay a smart lawyer. 
Get ready everyone! This is a glimpse of future of online information. Wonderful NYT article and I am glad that I have a subscription. Felicitations! 
Art is 'worth nothing and everything'. There is no monetary value to it except as a class of 'goods' which has been created by dealers and sold to wealthy patrons of the merchant class. Its value floats up and down over time (history) depending upon the taste of the ruling class. The monetary value of a work of art is irrelevant to most of us who love Art and love going to museums. Alas, for others it has become an investment vehicle for wealthy but often un-imaginitive investors. Its always been that way through history, its no big deal, its our culture. The Louvre is full of a lot of 'dead wood' and so is MOMA. Does anyone today remember Bouguereau who was all the rage at the end of the 19th century in Paris?<br/>
As Keats said: "Beauty is truth, truth beauty,--that is all Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know."

Apart from the all the drug taking and apparent thuggery involved, they are the terrible lies and the self-righteousness which make his story so ugly. 
ditto.... to Max Cornise insightful comment.
all this from draft dodger!<br/>
ha ha... it would be funny if it weren't so serious.
The whole war in Afghanistan is a hypocritical mess from which we cannot seem to exit nor deal with honestly. If this kid had killed a Russian soldier 25 years earlier what would our reaction have been?
Being a photographer myself I really love great photos; shots taken from unusual angles, as well as both formal and candid snapshots, but the photos of Steven Ercolino on the ground with red blood everywhere makes me think that we have gone to far in our obsession with instant news items. What would anyone feel seeing their loved one splattered about on the New York Times? I believe that a little reverence for the deceased family is needed in these cases. New York Times: do you have policy about where you draw the line? If not maybe you should.
Do we as a nation believe in redemption?<br/>
For us as citizens this is the simple, moral decision to answer.<br/>
If so, then he should be released, because in so many other areas of life in America we do seem to accept this reasoning.<br/>
Why is it so different for this young man?
Sadly, It seems that in America vulgarity has become the passport to success.
Well, what  Apple advertises just isn't so regarding battery life on machines using Lion. Myself, and countless others have new  (2011) MBP's which barely get 1.5 hours of just surfing the internet and picking up mail. Apple should stop the false advertising, or fix this issue.
I do not use Facebook for many of the reasons cited in this article but with so many dedicated users is it so mad to imagine that the users themselves pay for the service which Facebook provides? After all, we pay the internet providers, we pay electric bills, we pay for gasoline, some of us even pay the New York Times each week for its content. Why wouldn't people pay even just one dollar a month for keeping an account on Facebook? With almost a billion users that could make a lot of money. Obviously, the younger (under 30) generation doesn't believe in paying for any internet services whether its Facebook, music or films. I suppose that is the real problem against this idea,,,alas.
For the life of me its impossible to imagine that there is no Universal health care in America. How can this be?
Worry and be happy!
With a name like Achilles what do you expect to happen?
A shame he didn't cop the plea which was was offered by the DA at the outset to do community work to amend his 'stupid' (sic) act). He could have owned up to his behavior and not tried to defend what he did by getting a lawyer. This was his way of saying that he did no wrong. It would have been a great lesson for everyone involved had he accepted responsibility for his actions. Now, he faces prison which is really a shame for him and his family. A lesson was lost here.
Three words for congress: Shame On You.<br/>A four year old is more reasonable.
If my school tax dollars aren't going to the PUBLIC school, why should I pay them?<br/>I am not going to underwrite someone's choice of a non-public school. My parents paid to send us to private school. The taxpayers did not.
In typical Rovian Republican fashion, now that Romney appears to have the nomination for panderer-in-chief, and more women favor the president, let's blame Mr. Obama for the reasons women dislike Republicans.<br/><br/>And, Romney is also familiar with the back peddling he is now  engaged in regarding women as it is the same in the LDS church which claims that women are treated equally.<br/>
Equally as long it is barefoot and pregnant and always subservient to their husbands. 
The pity is, that the cost of the care given to our pets is actually very reasonable when compared to the cost of treatment for humans for the same ailments.<br/>
How is it that we can deliver the same service to a pet for 1/10th the cost when compared to what a human animal pays for the same level of care?<br/>
The vet is trained exactly as a human doc.<br/>
It shouldn't be a question of whether or not that the pet merits such care; it is a matter of commitment.<br/>
Once you make a commitment to that animal, you're committed.<br/>
Period.<br/>
Would you walk away from your family members with similar ailments?
I am sorry, but, I admit failure.<br/>
There is no ethical reason to eat a dead animal.<br/>
Forgive me, I am only human. An animal also.
What are we waiting for here? How many animals have to die unnecessarily, for nothing but human self gratification? This is an industry that needs to be shut down. As usual, the almighty dollar rules. 
What is most amazing by the general response to Mark's column is the irrational defense of the entire meat issue.<br/>
Whether or not eating meat is good or bad for one is irrelevant.<br/>
It is a fact that humans do not need to consume the flesh of another animal in order to survive and survive well.<br/>
The true fact here is that the industries such as fast food, cattle producers, etc. have all succeeded in their marketing<br/>
to make us think that we need to consume the flesh of another animal 21 times a week.<br/>
Preposterous. 
I want to know who has the clout to make someone like NewtGingrich or Tim Pawlenty and countless others, backtrack on their "off message or non party line" comments, with 24 hours of speaking them?<br/>
And, what is it that is said that makes these politicians knuckle under to the "party" line?<br/>
WHO, really is running these politicians (in this instance, the Republicans) ?
The light of day needs to shine on the underpinnings of this orchestrated attack on the environment by the GOP at all levels of government. <br/><br/>One ruse that Maine Governor LePage uses is that protection of the environment is burdensom to business and was keeping business out of the state of Maine. Sound familiar? He held state-wide "red tape sessions" to hear from business about how much red tape was hurting them.<br/><br/>There was virtually no mention of the environment as being the problem. <br/><br/>Of course that doesn't matter, because the mandate here is not one from the people, but, rather, one from the likes of the Koch brothers, the US Chamber of Commerce, large corporations, and who else? <br/><br/>In the case of Maine, financial support for the governor came from out-of-state corporations with no presence in the state, and no plans to enter the state to conduct their business. <br/><br/>However, setting a precedent is the key, so any state will do to start that process.<br/><br/>With such coordination of message and effort one has to ask: Who is really running the show here? Not the governors, and not members of congress. Who has so much clout as to demand and receive this level of compliance from GOP "lawmakers"? <br/><br/>This is no spontaneous, "grass roots" operation.
<p>I don't mind paying if those annoying pop up ads and most other ads would be eliminated. What happened to the Times reader?</p>

There are plenty of excellent products which do not leave a film, so let's not use this as an excuse to revert back to those products with phosphates. Check out the hardness of the water as well. 
The argument that the animals belong to the public is interesting. These "public" animals are killed by or for ranchers when the ranchers consider it necessary. Apparently it is acceptable to kill the  "public" animals, but, not to protect them. 
Where in the first amendment is there mention of "special cases"?<br />In the narrowest interpretation of the court, regarding simply selling the videos, the decision is correct. BUT, there are no footnotes to the first amendment nor "special cases", and, thus, the door could be opened to sell child pornography and all other similarly offense materials.<br />There is no difference between the "intrinsically related underlying abuse" and the selling of animal cruelty or child pornography videos. Abuse is what fuels the engine.
If sustaining a gloomy response to any potential economic revival will work to the political advantage of either or both parties, then gloom it will be.<br />Much like feigning prolonged injury to sway a jury for a higher settlement.
Life is full of disappointments, Bill. It isn't about you or your expectations.<br />The only people entitled to be disappointed in Tiger's behavior are his family. Not some stuffy<br />golf club president. This hypocrisy from the same organization who nearly had apoplexy when<br />Annika wanted to play there. Get over yourself.
This is just another disingenuous ploy. Black Americans represent about 13+% of the population and have about 20% of the total number of babies born in the US. Don't be fooled on this. There are more important issues at be concerned about.
Boehner has once again shown that he is not a leader, but a panderer.  If the tea party wants changes to the ACA, do it through legislation, not a tantrum that shuts down the government.<br/><br/>The Senate should, and will, reject this garbage and they should attach a requirement that no member of Congress, or their staff, be paid during a shutdown.  In fact, pay should be forfeited, 
"....the official agreed to discuss planning options only on condition of anonymity...."<br/><br/>Well, that's a good thing.  We sure don't want to tip off our plans in advance!<br/><br/>Maybe just telling them our plans will be sufficient and we will not foolishly proceed to actually attack Syria.  There is no winning strategy for us, or the Syrian people.  Why do we never learn from previous mistakes?<br/><br/>Does the bombs away crowd have a plan to pay for this fireworks show or will we just cut food stamps and education another 10 or 20 percent?
Instead of wasting resources on this non-problem, perhaps our Gov. might invest some effort to insure that Florida voters don't have to stand in line for up to 8 hours to vote.  What a creep.
Uh, raising sufficient revenue to pay for their spending plans?  Or, more accurately stated, balancing revenue with expenses.  Clearly, that is a concept that escapes most in our country.....democrat, republican and certainly the tea party types. <br/><br/>This plan is a terrible idea precisely because of the high risk of moral hazard created.  And, as Kurt NY said, every deadbeat entity will pile in, defaults will be large, essentially creating a federal bailout.  Maybe employees should not be faulted for relying on unrealistic promises.  However, their leaders and the politicians that made the foolish promises, in return for votes, and job security, deserve nothing.<br/><br/>The only solution is the simplest....negotiate reductions in pensions, eliminate them for the politicians, including those now, or due, to collect, until the problem is solved by putting revenue and expense on a sustainable path.  Perhaps Detroit could start by asking the state to impose a special tax on those corporations that benefitted from the last government bailout, the auto industry.<br/><br/>Do not look to me, a recently retired small business owner with no pension other than what I saved, to bail out public employees.  I, and millions like me, are still paying for the 2008 bailout in the form of historically low interest rates on savings.  Meanwhile, big banks get money for nothing and record profits for free, thanks in large part to a totally broken tax system that our politicians will not fix.
Good for you Mayor, I hope you are successful reducing the flow of campaign funds to these parasites who cherish nothing more than the political calculus that enhances their odds of feeding, for their entire life, at the public trough.<br/><br/>If we have learned anything these past few years it is that money is one of the few things that moves these people, hatred and ignorance being close behind.<br/><br/>As for the argument that we are better off with these hacks than a Republican majority, really?  But, that is a topic for another day.
Pathetic.  No matter how the NYT tries to shine up her image in an attempt to make the proverbial silk purse out of a sows ear, the fact remains that Quinn is still an arrogant, out of control bully with anger management issues.  She has shown, on more than one occasion, that her own agenda and desires trump those of the voters and citizens and, therefore, remains ill-suited to the task of leading the great city of New York.
Wonderful article, please continue your efforts to educate on this  issue.  Hard to decide which is of more concern and threatening to our long term survival.....GMO food ecosystems or our gutless, corrupt government. 
Dream on....a large group of Americans, those who aspire to be part of the un-intelligentsia, applaud this boorish behavior by the GOP designed to prolong their careers at the public trough.
Well, congratulations are in order, you succeeded.  However, your political predilections are all too common in our country today.  How sad that the crooked Senator and crooked Dr. pal are not in jail.
Goodbye, good luck.  The Senate will, if that is possible, be a better place without him.  I am sure he will not forget to take his fat pension and benefits with him.....just another entitled "conservative" politician....as he bellies up to the trough for his next big multi-million dollar meal.  Who say public service isn't rewarding?
Most intelligent, hard working, news-accuracy confirming voters realize by now that Obamas legacy will be a sad one.  Here was a perfect, once in a lifetime opportunity for Blacks in America to do MLK proud by helping elect as Americas first black President, one who would bring our country together.  <br/><br/>Instead, since his election in 2008, the first black ever to serve in the highest office in our land has tragically divided our nation along political, racial, class and gender lines.  In 2012, this individual, with a slick tongue was re-elected, not by the Caucasian majority, who had apathetically turned their backs on the voting booths, but instead by those on food stamps and those Blacks who apparently really didnt care about the future of the country, as long as one of them was back in. <br/><br/>What a missed opportunity!  Given his legacy, and the damage he has done to our nation, and its place on the World stage, I doubt there will be another Black elected to the Office of the President for many, many generations to come. I really feel he has tarnished his race, and the wonderful legacy left by MLK.
What better indicator that the U.S. is in serious decline as a political, economic and military power than events that have evolved over the past 5 years.  And clearly, the rate of decline has now started to accelerate. Unfortunately narcissism amongst the politically elite , and naivety within the voting public have blinded America, much as events in Roman times foreshadowed the fall of their empire.<br/><br/>As a Canadian, with many American friends, it saddens me to see the rapid deterioration of a once great country.  Here we are a resource based economy, and are already looking East and West for new partnerships.<br/><br/>20  30 years ago few of us living in our global community would have predicted the accelerating collapse of the American way of life.
As a Canadian I have to chuckle when I see the U.S. politically elite thumping their chests about taking the moral high ground, and being the worlds guardian of morals, values and ethics.<br/><br/>The current U.S. political structure has to be the most corrupt in the world today.<br/><br/>And a final note.  The U.S. has not won a war since it participated with the Allies in WW2.  You lost in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, Egypt, Libya, and you will lose in Syria.  You should be ashamed of yourselves.  The outside world has, in 5 short years, lost all respect for America.  You voted for this dolt who leads you.  Now you deserve what you get.  
OK it's now dead.  Move on with more important matters.  The Constitution has survived another attack.

The truth hurts!  Americans have to make a choice between FREE HANDOUTS ... and FREEDOM.<br/><br/>Once these entitlement types, backed by the left-wing AARP and media get a taste of the Soviet era life, they may finally wake up.  But by then it will be too late.
The truth hurts!  At least Gov. Romney can be trusted. The problem is that the sheep of the democratic regime cannot stand the truth!

He'll likely take it from the policemens' union fund.  Isn't that the Chicago way?
I could not expect a better team to lead America during these tough times than Romney and Ryan.  What a race to come! What a great year!  Finally a breath of fresh air.<br/><br/>America has a choice now.  Whether we want the next four to mirror the last four, or whether we want to return to a positive, united, and prosperous nation.<br/><br/>The electors will decide their future in Nov.  I sure hope they make the right choice.

As we say in hockey ..."No guts, no glory".  that's why Romney has been a successful leader in business, and will make a great President. <br/><br/>Obama lacks both!  
What a class act. Pres. Bush knows that if he were to attend, the Democratic zealots would twist the occasion just as they twist everything else. Past democratic presidents lack that class. <br/><br/>You can bet however that he fully supports President-to-be Romney, and will assist in whatever ways he can.... behind the scenes. Sure would be nice if certain previous Presidents had the same class.
Your "News" article title suggests sadly that blacks don't have the ability to choose the best candidate, but instead are like sheep, easily led.<br/><br/>There are many of us who blindly supported Obama in 2008, admittedly because he was a brother.  Now I'm embarrassed that we may well have set back all the progress that we've  worked so hard to improve on over the past 50 years.  <br/><br/>His term in office will go down in history as a major disappointment, and sadly I won't likely see another brother in the Oval Office before my time has passed.   No wonder race relations here are in such a mess.
My suggestion is to:<br/><br/>1] eliminate the dividend tax credit, and<br/>
2] tax capital gains at the marginal tax rate<br/><br/>That would shut Buffett up real fast.  He doesn't take a salary but instead is paid dividends and given options.  No wonder he has a lower tax rate than his secretary.<br/><br/>In addition:<br/><br/>3] implement a progressive VAT, with the only exemptions being zero tax on food (purchased at the supermarket), minimum tax on purchased meals under say $25 per person (that makes fast food affordable for families)<br/><br/>4] cut the mortgage interest tax deductibility immediately to 50%, and eventually to 20%
It is one thing for a person to see your face in public -- there is no expectation of privacy.<br/><br/>It is another thing for a person to trail you around recording your every move every day -- that is stalking.<br/><br/>It is one thing for a person to see the address (meta data) on the outside of a envelope of a single piece of mail -- there is no expectation of privacy.<br/><br/>It is another thing for a person to be recording and saving the addresses on every single piece of mail we send and receive -- that is stalking.<br/><br/>Somehow judges do not see to understand that the public wants things that are legal when done incidentally made illegal when it becomes someone's or some agency's paranoid obsession.
LT says, "So we want our spy agencies to spy but get all upset when we find out that they're doing it."<br/><br/>You want our soldiers to kill, but would you not be upset if they killed innocent Americans and innocent foreigners?<br/><br/>It is the same thing.
It didn't have anything on me, so no <a href="http://pipl.com" title="pipl.com" target="_blank">pipl.com</a> has less on us than the NSA.<br/><br/>More to the point, <a href="http://pipl.com" title="pipl.com" target="_blank">pipl.com</a> is not going to subject me to a signature drone strike or put me on a no-fly list.
To those who say, "if you have nothing to hide you have nothing to fear" please post the itinerary for your 5 year-old daughter next week.<br/><br/>Give your husband a list of everything you've said about him to your best friend.<br/><br/>Give your employer the browsing history of your 16 year-old son or daughter.<br/><br/>Yes, only those without a life have nothing to hide.<br/><br/>The rest of us have plenty of things that spies can use to blackmail us.
The big risk I see is that the NSA will gather information on current and future political, business, academic, scientific, religious and journalistic leaders.  These people do not lead dull boring lives.<br/><br/>If it is true that all of NSAs work has a foreign intelligence purpose and is "centered on counterterrorism, counterproliferation and cybersecurity" why are so many people in Congress acting like they're so fearful of the NSA, acting so deferential as if the NSA has something on them?
Note the code names, Bullrun and Edgewater, are names of US and UK civil war battles.<br/><br/>I think that is pretty much an admission that these spy agencies are targeting their fellow citizens and the political, business and academic leaders of their fellow citizens.<br/><br/>I feel we are going to see the Putinization of America, where the main business and political leaders are increasingly ex-CIA and ex-NSA.
Including gun ownership, meaning the NSA has created something that could easily be converted into a detailed gun registry on US citizens and US residents.  The admit interrogating it for words like pressure cookers and email addresses, they could just as easily interrogate on names of guns, titles of books, anything.
Consider the gun registry and gun control aspects of NSA surveillance.<br/><br/>Many Americans have trouble going from the theory of surveillance to how NSA surveillance affects them.  If they did nothing wrong, what do they have to worry about?<br/><br/>So give them the practical example of guns, gun registration, and gun control.  <br/><br/>That is something many understand and care about.<br/><br/>A national gun database is the natural sub-product of the data gathered by NSA surveillance.  The NSA can search on gun model numbers and keywords like shooting and hunting just as easily as any other words.<br/><br/>The NSA data creates a fairly accurate and complete searchable "national registry of everything", including gun ownership, gun location and gun use.<br/><br/>If you don't mention your guns online, your friends may, and that is enough.<br/><br/>The government does not need a special gun registry, the NSA is creating a registry of everything.<br/><br/>Books, movies, hobbies, guns, technologically the NSA can interrogate their database on anything.
The meaning of words with multiple definitions comes from context.  That is how it works in the English language.<br/><br/>When you connect the words "target" and "no" in answering a question that asks whether the agency listened to the phone calls or read the e-mails and text messages of American citizens with the word target you are implicitly using a definition of target that means sender or receiver of emails.<br/><br/>Sure, in some other context target might mean something else, like concentric red rings on a white background, but that was not the context in which the answer was given.<br/><br/>The NSA just keeps lying.
I think a lot of Americans are having trouble going from the theory of surveillance into what it means for them in their lives.  Why should they worry?  How does it affect them?<br/><br/>Give them the practical example of guns and how the NSA is able to deduce who owns guns, how many guns, how they are stored, when and where they are generally used, using cellphone metadata, using email messages, using Facebook shares, and so on.  If you don't mention them, your friends may, and that is enough.<br/><br/>The government does not need a voluntary or compulsory gun registry.<br/><br/>A national gun registry is the natural outcome of the data gathered by NSA surveillance.  That data creates, or could create at a moment's notice, a fairly accurate and complete searchable national gun registry for the federal government to find who owns what guns and where they keep them.<br/><br/>The NSA surveillance makes possible registries of a lot more too, religious and political beliefs, occupations, friends, business relationships, sleeping habits, hobbies, extra-marital affairs, donations, scams, gambling habits, drinking habits, jokes, movies seen, books read -- you name it, anything you talk about on the phone or on the web, or anything people say about you on the phone or on the web, it is all out there for global collection.<br/><br/>It also makes possible stealing secrets from one business to give to another.<br/><br/>But the gun registry aspect is all that many people will care about.
So you are with me in supporting Snowden as a hero and patriot?<br/><br/>If you support the NSA you support and endorse "the inexorable march of government into every avenue of citizen affairs and private life."
You left out subsidizing banks, the GOP was eager to bail out Wall St.<br/><br/>The law enforcement and justice industry's immense cash cow, "The War on Drugs", the GOP likes that too.<br/><br/>Basically any group with the money to buy their votes through campaign contributions.
The rules need to be changed and a time limit placed on filibusters so that they can delay but not prevent majority rule.<br/><br/>Perhaps a 30 day delay for any filibustered legislation, after which majority rule would apply.<br/><br/>And if Democrats are unable to get the rule change passed, they should do to Republicans what Republicans did to Democrats.  Yes, in the short run this may seem childish, but in the long run it is the necessary adult thing to do, because the current rules are destroying the USA's position in the world.
India, Ecuador, Venezuela and so on need to be aware that there is the US government, a bunch of people who come and go, and then there are the American people who aren't going anywhere.<br/><br/>Snowden is the USA's Tienanmen Square Tank Guy.  He broke the law but he is our hero.<br/><br/>He defied the bureaucracy to defend his nation's constitution and its people.<br/><br/>Siding against Snowden is like siding against Mandela -- diplomatically good in the short run because it gets you favor with the current government -- diplomatically bad in the long run because it angers the nation's people.
That was true of real slavery too.  But it was resolved in the end.<br/><br/>The middle class needs this and any elected official who opposes it is engaged in a war on the middle class.
I hope so.  You'd let someone into your house not knowing who he is?
E-Verify sounds like an excellent idea.  <br/><br/>Sure, employers who use illegal immigrants are going to complain about, obviously.  It means the end of the cheap slave labour they're addicted to.  But so what?  That level of greed is a vice not a virtue.<br/><br/>The important thing will be to ensure that paper work errors can be quickly fixed.  That should be easy enough to do with birth certificates, naturalization certificates and income tax records.
Exactly, this system can only survey ordinary people who are not expecting it.<br/><br/>It won't be effective against organized enemies of the USA.
The terrorists and enemy spies know they're subject to surveillance and take steps to prevent interception.<br/><br/>Which is why at least one of the cases the General he cracked with Prism was actually cracked by Scotland Yard using good old fashion conventional policing tactics (see Guardian.co.uk story).<br/><br/>So the surveillance is after people not hiding what they are doing, which would be ordinary US and allied foreign citizens.<br/><br/>This isn't about terrorists.  This is about the US Constitution and the 4th amendment.
You say you have nothing to hide?<br/><br/>And yet we have records from 10 years ago, back in 2013, that you regularly posted on the dissident website nytimes.com.<br/><br/>Also you sent text messages to people who frequently visited the insurgent website wired.com.<br/><br/>There is also the matter of the car you drive, that un-American Honda.  Your fourth un-American automobile.<br/><br/>Plus didn't you make a trip to Paris in 2015?  You stayed at the same hotel as EU government agents [employees].<br/><br/>It looks to me like you have a great deal to hide.
European commission's vice-president, Viviane Reding is asking US Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. these seven questions.<br/><br/>The answers to these questions will determine whether EU businesses will be able to store customer data on US-based systems.<br/><br/>1. Are Prism and other similar programmes aimed only at the data of US citizens and residents, or also  even primarily  at non-US nationals, including EU citizens?<br/><br/>2. Is access to, collection of or processing of data on the basis of Prism and other programmes  limited to specific and individual cases, and if so what criteria are applied?<br/><br/>3. Is the data of individuals accessed, collected or processed in bulk (or on a very wide scale, without justification relating to specific individual cases) either regularly or occasionally?<br/><br/>4. Is the scope of these programmes restricted to national security or foreign intelligence or is it broader?<br/><br/>5. What avenues, judicial or administrative, are available to companies in the US or the EU to challenge access to, collection of and processing of data under Prism or other programmes?<br/><br/>6.  What avenues are available to EU citizens to be told if they are affected by Prism or other similar programmes and how do they compare with those available to US citizens?<br/><br/>7. What avenues are available to EU citizens or companies to challenge access to, collection of and processing of their personal data under Prism and similar programmes, and how does that compare with the rights of US citizens?
So what is a good replacement for gmail and google, yahoo, hotmail, iCloud and Facebook for those of us who don't live in the USA and whose human rights are not covered by the US Constitution?<br/><br/>Universal NSA surveillance of us doesn't require a search warrant, not even when message contents are examined.<br/><br/>Obviously this continuing situation, which shows no signs of change, means that US companies are unsuitable web service providers for residents and citizens of the USA's NORAD and NATO partners.
Unfortunately the founding fathers did not include back people among humans with inalienable rights.<br/><br/>That was later fixed.<br/><br/>They didn't consider foreigners in foreign lands human either.  <br/><br/>Probably the founding fathers never conceived that any government could have the power to violate the human rights of 95% of humanity.<br/><br/>Rightly, foreigners don't get the right to vote or to immigrate to the USA.  <br/><br/>But we do have basic human rights because we are just as human as US citizens.  <br/><br/>A right you grant yourselves that you do not grant us is a right you do not regard as a human right.
Liberal way?  <br/><br/>Lying is neither a left-wing nor a right-wing trait.  Politicians from the ultra left-wing communist states lie.  Dictators from ultra right-wing dictatorships lie.  Middle of the road politicians lie too.<br/><br/>Lying is not on the left- right-wing axis.  Lying is on the honest-deceitful axis.  
I hope you remember that President Obama has your full support in 10 years when you're confronted with the "fact" that you've been posting on (what then might be) anti-American websites like nytimes.com.<br/><br/>They might also have some records of your cell calls to Tea Party members, some of whom took weapons to political rallies.  <br/><br/>A legal loophole at the time made this okay, but 10 years from now that might be regarded as treason.  Treason your cell phone calls specifically link you to.<br/><br/>You have a lot to fear from this surveillance given your communications habits.
How is this not a overt recipe for BLACKMAIL???  Seems one has NO right to privacy on any form of electronic media in this Land of the FREE????
The U.S. is "special" those Brazilians should just recognize how exceptional we are and be thankful that we are here to "protect" them. Ha!
Take it from a Professor.  Universities are business's - period.  When you recruit a super smart/motivated kid to your school; you are placing a long term BET that said kid will become a physician, captain of industry or Senator.  Schools figured out a long time ago that one super rich alumnus is worth a thousand regular folks. Welcome to the New "U"!  
The Temple Mount is the holiest place on earth. It should be open to all people without constraint.  The Palestinians have a lot of nerve preventing Christians and Jews from peacefully worshiping on this Holy site. If they want peace- they need to grow up.
If the ONLY reason you have for going to college is "what am I going to make" please do me a favor (Research I Prof. for 35 years)  don't go.
Well said- I agree with you 100%. However you seem to be quite naive about the military industrial complex who runs our country. They must be royally PO'd with Puti- suing for PEACE. OMG!
The commercial prison business is not going to like this. Heck- its good business to incarcerate a 19 year old for a few years for smoking the killer weed!
I am a Professor with 35 years of tenure. Bottom line - MOOC's are TRAINING- they have nothing to do with EDUCATION----- period.
Throughout the Middle East- might makes right.  Just ask Israel. They learned that their neighbors have no desire to talk- a sign of weakness.  Kill a few thousand and peace reigns.  Pretty sad huh?
Not a good idea Tamar.  DDT is cheap and effective- HOWEVER- it is one of the most persistent - biomagnifying organic chemicals ever invented. It may kill the mosquito's today- but it will kill you tomorrow.
I go to the deep Amazon annually.  I take Lariam. Some say it gives you weird dreams- I usually get an upset stomach. BUT- I never got malaria even when eaten by the anaphales mosquito.  Unless CDC can assure me that another drug will prevent this horrific disease- I will stick with Lariam.
OK so where does this end?  Universal guilt by association? Seems that our civil liberties are a thing of the past--------the road to the end of our nation. Nero fiddles while Rome burns?
Jeff Bezos-------the world is your cherry to pick!  You are a genius!
U.S. Toxic Imperialism.  Free Trade-Globalization means send our toxic garbage to third world countries and let them deal with the health and ecological consequences.  Unethical and immoral- period.
According the the World Health Organization the total number of deaths attributable to illegal drug overdose is approximately 59,000 per year.  Deaths from acute pesticide exposure exceeds  220,000 per year with an additional 6 million+ hospitalizations.  We must do a better job in regulating pesticides and monitoring the food supply.
And- let us hope they are not on the Sotheby's auction block after having being looted several years from now.
Clearly the one way trip to Mars is a better idea.  Its cheap and you already know the outcome!  I registered!
Most obviously a fossilized Velociraptor Dino Egg!!!!!!
Physicians and scientists are not "recruited."  Individuals must be brilliant, highly motivated and willing to be an indentured servant for more than a decade to qualify for such careers. No one is preventing anyone from any race or economic class from making the commitment.  Affirmative action can only go so far.
Umm? This is illegal based on all international law- so we are bragging about their nefarious, unethical and depraved prowess??
Bravo Doc. Could not have said it better myself.
Essay's, SAT's, AP extra grade point classes---- all meaningless. I have taught over 25,000 undergraduate students over the past 35 years. Give me a no holds barred 15 min. interview with a prospective student, and I will tell you with great confidence whether or not this student will be a successful leader. All the rest of it is a ruse.
Oh Please- they are cutting the price of the HPV vaccine because they can't sell enough of it here. The stockpiles are probably clogging up the warehouse. Follow the dollar folks!
Ahhh- the good ole days!  Each nations team should fight to the death- the winning team gets to pillage and plunder the losers country. Far more simple and less costly than thermonuclear war.
Seems that many of the comments support the idea that "serious archaeologists" have legitimately obtained and studies antiquities and turned them over to the great museums- Ummmm Hello-  those artifacts came from FOREIGN countries- i.e. the patrimony of that country- right??  Ex Post Facto- ALL ANTIQUITIES ARE EITHER LOOTED OR STOLEN.  Should we close down the Met because it houses thousands of Egyptian mummies, sarcophagi and sculptures???
Snowden is a hero.
I hate this.<br/>All of it.
This country is beyond hope.
In medical school, when one breaks a suture tying it, a common admonition is:<br/><br/>"Don't blame the suture; it's the jerk at the end of the knot."<br/><br/>Same thing: the robot is a tool. How well or poorly the tool is used depends on the surgeon.
WILL simply be overtaken???<br/><br/>That horse left the barn long ago.<br/><br/>We are doomed. History will not treat this generation kindly, if there are any historians.
When do these actions become treason?
Couldn't agree more. As a US citizen, I am not in a position to influence the Russian government, but (theoretically) can influence ours.<br/><br/>The fact is, though, I feel better about the Russians than ours.<br/><br/>That is a sad thing, and I hope that the actions of those like Mr. Snowden lead to a positive change.
The health insurance companies, They skim their 20-30% off the top of the health care dollar and contribute NOTHING to health care except bloated CEO salaries and returns for their shareholders.<br/><br/>You must understand that in this country profits are much more important than people.
Don't you wish George Orwell was still with us?
sorry...most juries are not the peers of those being tried. the more complex the case, the less the peer relationship.<br/><br/>I was told once that the cheapest seats in the old Yankee Stadium, where patrons sat in drunken stupor surrounded by clouds of marijuana smoke...<br/><br/>THAT was a plaintiff's attorney's ideal jury pool.<br/><br/>The system is rigged and always will be.
You are not "only" a nurse. The doctors get it: they get it every day, good and hard.<br/><br/>These decisions are made by health insurers, who as another commentator opined "care more about their stockholders than patients."<br/><br/>Just another abomination of the for-profit health care system here in 1984 Amerika.
this is just another obscenity foisted upon us by the health insurance cartel. welcome to Amerika.
arent we going that way anyway? just not so rapidly...
The court majority are political hacks.
Move along folks, nothing to see here.<br/><br/>Enjoy the bread and circuses....
After reading all the MD trashing in these pages in the last few years, it is quite refreshing to read about an incident that is not really noteworthy if one is a good physician: a patient is in pain, something is wrong, you go in and fix it, no matter what.<br/><br/>Not really newsworthy for us, but it always makes me ask the question: in this world of for-profit health insurance, giant corporations buying medical practices to improve their bottom line, decreasing reimbursement, increased aggravation, scrutiny, second-guessing, and paperwork....how did WE get to be the bad guys?
The price of infinite profits will eventually be revolution.
I ask again:<br/><br/>If there is no consequence to lying at one's confirmation hearing, why bother with the charade?<br/><br/>The supreme court majority are political hacks, nothing more, nothing less.<br/><br/>God help us all.
If there are no consequences to lying at one's confirmation hearing, why hold them at all?
The supreme court majority is made up of political hacks appointed for life.<br/><br/>God help us (and I'm an atheist.)
Fairly computer savvy here...did not work as advertised. Pursuing a refund of my $20.<br/>Fits the definition of "hi tech"......<br/><br/>almost works.
Nothing to see here folks, move on....
Pretty simple, the terrorists have won.<br/>Welcome to 1984.<br/>We are now a banana republic, and, really, have been since Saint Ronnie was elected.<br/>We are doomed.
I guess the terrorists have won.
When will politicians and the media call the Republican Party's behavior what it is?<br/>It is not:<br/>mulish<br/>oppoositional<br/><br/>It is treasonous and antithetical to the functioning of a Republic.<br/><br/>They should be tried as traitors to this country.
This part of the US Constitution bears repeating:<br/><br/>AMENDMENT IV<br/>"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized."<br/><br/>How can anyone with a straight face argue that the NSA's wholesale gathering up of our private communications isn't a blatant violation of the above prohibition?
This is a small bit of good news in a horrible summer. Wealth inequality has reached an all-time high, topping its previous peak which occurred in 1928, just prior to the Great Depression; a strong argument could be made that the 1929 crash &amp; subsequent depression were in fact caused by runaway income and wealth inequality.<br/>Because the super rich are sucking up virtually all of the economy's productivity-related income gains, the rest of us simply lack the purchasing power to maintain anything close to full employment in the US economy.<br/>Larry Summers has done much to exacerbate the growth of wealth inequality during his years of "public service;" thank goodness he's being held to account for it in this instance.
To "Aloha:"<br/>And what of the Saudis, the Qataris, the Israelis and the US flooding Syria with weapons and foreign fighters? They share an equal (if not greater) share of responsibility as the Russians for the carnage visited upon Syria's people.
"Everyone knows it was the Syrian government"?<br/>Assad was winning, and consolidating his gains. He had ZERO motivation to use chemical weapons, while Prince Bandar had EVERY reason to supply his al-Qaeda "rebels" with chemical agents, in order to lure the US into the conflict. For all we know, this may even have been accomplished with CIA complicity... which would go a long way towards explaining that agency's "high confidence" that Assad is behind the attack. <br/><br/>Look at who has the most to gain, and the most to lose. I am not convinced that this wasn't a false flag attack.
David wrote: "The founders of the United Nations did not envision that a seat on the Security Council was a license to ignore or overrule every tenet of international law, on the grounds that anything that any permanent member of the Security Council allows must therefore be allowed."<br/><br/>The permanent member veto power in the UN Security Council doesn't seem to be a problem when it's the US repeatedly wielding said veto power in order to protect Israel from accountability over its illegal settlements and despicable treatment of Palestinians living under Israeli occupation. In fact, nearly three decades ago, after the International Court of Justice ruled (Nicaragua vs The United States 1986 - I.C.J. 14) that the US violated international law by supporting the Contras and mining Nicaragua's harbors, the US actually vetoed a Security Council resolution simply calling upon all nations to abide by international law!<br/><br/>Any US attack (or THREAT of attack) on Syria without being approved by the Security Council is unlawful under the UN Charter. Period.
This country has certainly not been "dragged to the left." If it had, we would all be enjoying Medicare for all / single-payer health care, Social Security benefits would be massively increased (thanks to the removal of the regressive cap on FICA taxes), a long-overdue end to impunity for Wall Street criminals, and a government that doesn't spy on all of its own citizens.<br/><br/>Art Pope, the Brothers Koch, Rupert Murdoch, Richard Mellon Scaife, Sheldon Adelson and countless other right-wing billionaires, in coordination with well-funded pro-corporate lobbies &amp; think-tanks such as the Heritage Foundation, the US Chamber of Commerce and the American Legislative Exchange Conference (ALEC) -- among many others, have completely corrupted and captured our congress and many of our state governments. Collective bargaining rights are being gutted, women's medical privacy has been destroyed, wages are stagnant or falling, income &amp; wealth inequality has reached obscene heights... These are ALL signs of the country's rightward lurch.<br/><br/>The US is the land of Pinochet, not Allende.
As usual, Karen, you hit the nail on the head better than I ever could.<br/>Those at the levers of power have never been held accountable for horrendous war crimes; fraudster bankers and government contractors plunder the commons with absolute impunity; meanwhile the principled actions of a conscientious person like Mr. Snowden are condemned by the ignoble Thomas Friedman.<br/>Washington Consensus mouthpieces like Friedman are blind to anything but the dictates of the rich and powerful.
Based on what I've read, I'm guessing that Mr. Snowden is probably quite savvy about such things, and likely has taken measures to protect his data and passphrase.<br/>For example, he would surely know that it is necessary to hide the signal generated by his keystrokes when entering his passphrase. That level of sophistication (and justified paranoia) was evident in the reports of his behavior during the time he was holed up in Hong Kong.<br/>At this point, Edward Snowden is not the only one with access to all of the encrypted data; as Glenn Greenwald pointed out a couple weeks ago, Mr. Snowden has taken steps to ensure the release of all the classified material in the event that he suffers an "accident."
Charles, Mr. Snowden did not contact Wikileaks. He carefully worked with the Guardian newspaper in London to make sure that any release of classified information was in the public interest.<br/>Given the worldwide outrage over the US spying on its own citizens and allies, Mr. Snowden made the right call.
People post to Facebook knowing that it's a public (or semi-public) forum, and that expectations of privacy are limited.<br/>However, we have a reasonable expectation that our private emails, phone calls, text messages, and Skype chats are just that: PRIVATE.<br/>Snowden revealed clearly that NONE of our electronic communications are safe: they are stored wholesale, and can be trolled through at will, real time or at any point in the future, by anyone with the proper clearance (and there are thousands and thousands of contractors and NSA employees with such clearance and capabilities).<br/>The primary target of any mass surveillance state is its own citizenry.
The law certainly provides for execution of those who violate the laws of our national security state. Bradley Manning could have been executed had he been convicted of the ridiculous "Aiding the Enemy" charge against him.<br/>The law also provided penalties for companies who violated customer privacy; but our elites didn't like that law when it became clear that citizens would sue said companies (AKA campaign donors) for cooperating with Bush's unlawful warrantless wiretapping, so they retroactively granted immunity to them in July 2008 (a shameful act which then-Senator Obama supported).<br/>Only laws against us "little people" are enforced nowadays.<br/>As for "treasonous acts," your definition and mine are quite different. The rogue corporations and government agencies, lobbying our corrupt representatives for more and more tax money in order to build a pervasive surveillance state, perpetrating the wholesale violation of our Fourth Amendment rights, seem a whole lot more treasonous to me than the guy who revealed the extent of these abuses.
One can only hope so, Stan.
If Edward Snowden thought he could receive the fair treatment he deserves as a whistleblower in the US, he wouldn't have felt the need to flee. The overzealous prosecution (and torture) of PFC Bradley Manning demonstrates that there is a war on whistleblowers in the US, and a fair trial is impossible.<br/>As it happens, Russia is one of the only countries remaining on the planet which can stand up to US bullying.<br/>by the way, if the US hadn't capriciously invalidated Mr. Snowden's passport, he would already be living in one of the courageous Latin American nations that has offered him political asylum.
It amazes me that a large percentage of the comments do not recognize the serious threat to our BASIC freedoms created by a ubiquitous surveillance state. Have so few of you read (or understood) George Orwell's dystopian novel "1984" that you now fail to recognize that Orwell's predictions (zero privacy, endless war, gov't doublespeak) coming true before our very eyes?<br/>When someone in a position of power has access to ALL of your electronic communications (and perhaps even your spoken words, given the capabilities of cell phones as real-time bugs), your life can be destroyed on a whim. The potential for abuse is unlimited.<br/>Don't you suppose that NSA director Keith Alexander has enough dirt on enough members of congress that they are unwilling to reign in his rogue fiefdom? And, as Mr. Snowden himself asserted, ANYONE can be painted as suspect when you have access to ALL of their electronic data.<br/>Google, Facebook, Yahoo, Apple, Verizon, AT&amp;T and Microsoft / Skype are all complicit in this unholy government / private contractor scheme to lay bare the lives of EVERY private citizen on the planet. Is this the kind of world we want to live in?
Carol Ring: but sugar is very delicious! I'm sorry, but apple crisp made with honey just doesn't taste right.
Oh, there are plenty enough rich people to carry the load. It's just that as their incomes have skyrocketed (while the rest of us have seen our wages stagnate and fall), their tax burden has shrunk at the same time!<br/>Perhaps you didn't read those little things known as "facts" listed in Dr. Stiglitz's OpEd? If you had, you would know that the cause of our predicament is precisely that the lower and middle classes have already been stuck with a disproportionately large share of the tax burden (compared to large corporations and the wealthy), and it's killing our economy.
I was pleasantly surprised to see Ben's excellent article on the cover of the NYTimes magazine. This is exactly the kind of information that has been for dcades stifled from US popular media. Kudos to the Times for publishing it, and thanks to Ben Ehrenreich for having the courage and compassion to represent those who have for so long been silenced.
That sounds like something I could use, since I pay off my entire balance every month.<br/>Unfortunately it's being offered by Bank of America... I'd sooner bank with Bernie Madoff.
Another victim of an ambitious and over-zealous federal prosecutor, in this case Massachusetts US Attorney Carmen Ortiz.<br/>
While the feds viciously throw the full weight and power of the Dept of Justice onto folks who heroically attempt to inform the people of what's really going on (Bradley Manning, Julian Assange, Aaron Schwartz, John Kiriakou, etc), HSBC gets a pass on laundering billions for drug cartels, and not a single Wall St executive is indicted for the rampant mortgage and securities fraud which destroyed the lives of millions of American citizens... and of course, Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Yoo, Addington et al will never see the inside of a courtroom in spite of their heinous and widespread torture of helpless detainees. Oh, and nobody was ever held accountable for the massive illegal warrantless wiretapping of US citizens either.<br/>
The king's justice is only for the peasantry.
Disgusting.
After saying that there's no way he will repeat his 2011 blunder of negotiating over the debt ceiling, Mr. Obama is doing just that.<br/><br/>I hope I'm wrong, but it seems to me that by floating the twin trial balloons of offering to raise the Medicare eligibility age and implement the chained CPI Social Security benefit cut, the president has signaled what he is willing to trade away in exchange for raising the debt limit.<br/>
The result: the GOP gets to start dismantling the New Deal while the Democrats get rightfully blamed for it.
Excellent suggestions. Another would be, eventually, to phase in some type of "Medicare for all"... start with the 55-to-65 year-olds, then 45 to 55, and so on, until everyone has basic preventative and catastrophic health coverage. The private market could still exist to provide coverage for non-urgent procedures-- hip replacement, cosmetic surgery, etc.<br/>
The state of Vermont is taking the lead on this, implementing Gov. Shumlin's "Green Mountain Care", a state single-payer plan scheduled to take effect by 2017.<br/>
It is sad to see that so many people, including Matt Bai, are buying that bill of goods which claims that "entitlements" must be cut in exchange for letting Bush's tax cuts for the rich expire. Our social insurance programs are vital to a vast majority of the citizens of this country, and if 85% opposition to Social Security cuts (according to a 2010 SurveyUSA poll) doesn't constitute a "mandate" for the president, I don't know what does.
I disagree. This article is actually quite easy on Israel... it makes no mention of several recent Israeli military actions which precipitated the "unprovoked" rocket attacks you refer to.
And what actions precipitated the rocket fire you refer to? Might it be the spate of unprovoked, targeted assassinations of Hamas members by the IDF during the past several months?
Actually, what the article leaves out are the many provocations committed by Israel which precipitated the rocket fire. Take, for example, the headline in the Israeli newspaper <a href="http://Ynetnews.com" title="Ynetnews.com" target="_blank">Ynetnews.com</a> from OCT 14: "Surgical strikes are worth risk of rocket fire."
In the 60's the saying was "Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they aren't out to get you."  The freedom of information act later revealed that the FBI was spying on Vietnam protestors and civil rights leaders.  The NSA, of course, claims an immunity to the freedom of information act or any other restraint on their actions.
The cold war is over buddy and the only real enemies our free society has are the "domestic" ones of which the NSA is the biggest offender.  Trying to classify evidence of a crime committed by an agency of the Federal government is close to treason when the crime undermines the Constitution.
"Limiting" won't do.  They have to be stopped and the damage they have done to the security of the internet an our communications in general must be repaired.   
Our spy agencies are supposed to be attacking our enemies, not us.  That is why the CIA was forbidden to operate in the US when it was founded.   Spies, operate in secret, lie to everyone, break laws, etc. because they are operating in an enemy country surrounded by a hostile public. <br/><br/>When the same techniques are used at home they are both unnecessary and dangerous.  Here the terrorists are hiding from our public and the police and other agencies that protect us should be able to operate in the open.  It is essential to our safety that any of these agencies is subject to the freedom of information act, the press, and other forms of public supervision.  The NSA regards the American public as their enemies because we are.  They are a threat to all of us and to our system of government.  The terrorists can't overthrow the US government.  The NSA is putting place the tools required to do that.
Why?  Do you really think this increases your security?  The authorities knew about the Boston bombers, the underwear bomber, etc and it didn't help.<br/><br/>You are more likely to be hit by lightning then hurt in a terrorist attack.  On the other hand, a government agency that can order people to give them access to all your communications and threaten them with jail if they reveal that to the public is capable of blackmailing the politicians and taking over the government.  The terrorists can't overthrow our democracy, the NSA can.  Creating an agency with that kind of power is crazy and irresponsible.
Everyone is guilty until proven innocent.  It goes along with the secret laws, secret courts, and the use of threats to hide what they are up to.  I remember this from the cold war.  The old Soviet system lives on, but now it is being implemented in the US by the NSA.  These people are the greatest threat to America's security and our system of government within living memory.  They must be stopped soon or you can kiss all of your rights good bye!
This problem could be mostly fixed by getting the country's medical spending down to 9% of the economy where it was during the Clinton administration from the 18% it is now or the 36% it will be in 20 years.  That would involve restoring price competition so prices went down instead of up every year.  The culprit there is health insurance which covers everything and hides the prices of everything.  If our health insurance worked like our car insurance and only covered the worst situations, there would be a real incentive for the industry to become cost efficient and the most efficient suppliers would thrive at the expense overpriced institutions we are stuck with now.  Unfortunately, that is now illegal, so we are doomed. 
"To the man holding a hammer, every problem is a nail."  The Defense Department prepares for and wages war.  Diplomacy is not their specialty.
It was a "lucky break" in Iceland that ended the cold war and destroyed the Soviet Union.  If Regan and Gorbachev had listened to their advisers, the cold war might still be going on.  Accepting an idea that is outrageous on the face of it is the only way of escaping a stalemate.
At least the protesters in Cairo understood that the government is the problem.  These people are so blind that they can't see the big businesses bribing the politicians to write laws that allow the abusive behavior they are complaining about.  Paying off Congress is the most profitable business activity in the US.  Is greed good when the greedy person is in Congress?
I agree with you except for the claim that the President is entitled to attack a country that has not attacked the US or US forces without prior consent of Congress.  That doesn't qualify as an emergency and the War Powers Act doesn't authorize it.  The President is claiming an authority he doesn't need and doesn't have.<br/><br/>Going to Congress was a smart political move, a good diplomatic one, and a legal necessity.
The generation that survived the great depression and fought WWII is dead.  What else did you expect?  Pot smoking hippies don't make good bankers and neither do Harvard educated managers.<br/><br/>Remember "It's a wonderful life", the film that shows every Christmas?  Bring  back the laws that were going to send the main character to jail for losing his depositor's money and the problem will be fixed.
Prosecuting the businessmen makes no sense.  Fixing the government that enabled them with "deregulation" and "to big to fail" is the only way to prevent a repeat.  Besides, the fraud is ongoing.  They are still creating "securities" out of bad debt and marketing them.  How can the government prosecute what it's "reformed" regulations still allow?
Changing the laws by redefining the words they are written in was always a bad idea and one with completely unpredictable consequences:<br/><br/>The feminists wanted to change all the laws so that "man" would mean either man or woman and almost did until the public realized women would be subject to the draft.  <br/><br/>The "person hood initiative" would make a fertilized egg a "person" under the law.  That would not only make abortion murder but also most birth control pills, in vitro fertilization, and any attempt to save the mother in the case of an eptopic pregnancy, miss carriage, etc.<br/><br/>Gay marriage changes an institution intended to provide for children into one where only the adults matter.  There is no reason for the government to even care about such an institution let alone make it "official".  Marriage is not the union of a man and a woman, it is a commitment to the next generation and an involentary one at that, in most societies.
I suppose it is "courageous" for a politician to defy the American public and drag them into a war but only if they don't have enough special interest "campaign donations" saved up for attack adds to stop a primary challenge.  The "Military Industrial Complex" pays well.
Be careful about the "water buffaloes".  Some people think that is a racial insult and the rest of us would think you are a ignoramos if you intended it to be.
I agree.  It would be better to start repealing laws and reducing the prison population to those that are an actual threat to others.  
Do we really need more lawyers?  The Japanese used to claim that the reason they were doing well technically was that they had ten engineers for every lawyer and we had ten lawyers for every engineer.  Of course their main criticism of us was Harvard business school and the quarterly report i.e. pointy haired managers like Dilbert's boss.
"One attractive set of products is new cancer drugs, which can fetch high prices."  An excellent example of why our healthcare industry is destroying the economy.  Thanks to health insurance, no one would consider competing in this industry based on the price of their products and services.  <br/><br/>Food is also a necessity.  If we gave everyone a "food insurance card" that worked like our medical insurance cards, MacDonalds would be out of business, we would be eating at Texas Steak House or one of those French places that already have no prices on the menu.  Soon the food insurance premiums would be bankrupting us and we would be just as fat and diabetic as before.  Our healthcare has the same problem.
The security establishment that was set up after 9/11 is designed to protect the government, not the American people.  It threatens our existence as a democracy and a free country in ways no foreign enemy ever could.  We have to get the "Patriot" Act and the rest of these crazy laws repealed or our transformation into a police state will continue until all of our rights are wiped out for the convenience and safety of those in power.
Actually Wall Street is a casino where the players pretend that the prices that stock is bought and sold for have some relationship to either the company whose name is on the paper or the economy in general.  It is a big exercise in asset speculation except the "asset" can't be turned into money except by finding a greater fool to buy it because the "ownership" it offers is largely fictitious.
Eisenhower also played golf and was moderately successful at keeping the country out of trouble, mostly because his strategy was better than our last two Presidents.  We would be better off if both of them had stuck to practicing putting.
I am already confident that our government can't be trusted with this kind of power, especially in the hands of a secret agency.  As long as men seek power, the public must be careful to prevent them from getting it or we will all wind up as slaves.  The "Patriot" Act must be repealed and the NSA's spying on the public stopped.  We didn't need anything like this for the last 200 years in spite of innumerable wars and a civil war and we can't allow it now.   
The reality is that healthcare costs are a cancer that is eating our economy and Obama Care makes that problem worse by preventing any meaningful reform.  They cost 9% of GDP during the Clinton administration and are now up to 18%, almost as much as the IRS collects in taxes.  The cost of joint replacement surgery in Europe is 6 times lower than in the US, for example.  The thing that is driving the steady increase in costs is our insurance system which effectively removes price competition and encourages ever increased inefficiency.  The insurance "mandate" keeps this system in place and forbids individuals and companies from getting rid of it.<br/><br/>The only way to achieve universal access to health care is to make it affordable.  That will require reintroducing price competition to the industry and downsizing it by about a factor of six.  It won't happen as long as the healthcare lobby is allowed to write laws like Obama Care and  bribe Congress to pass them.  We don't need Rolls Royce healthcare that is no better than Toyota healthcare but costs ten times as much.  That is whet we have now.
For the moment the military may have convinced the educated population that they need the military to prevent the Brotherhood from imposing Taliban style Sharia law on them.  The Brotherhood needs to wise up to the fact that many Egyptians prefer a military dictatorship to a religious one.  The "tyranny of the majority" is still tyranny.  The Constitution needs a bill of rights but the Islamists won't allow it so they can only gain power by bloodshed.  
 When you have the reality of unlimited money you have the reality of unlimited fantasies.
Or does it take a bigger person to NOT fire the single missile into a foreign country - an act of war with wide spread implications - not to mention the killing of people who could be completely innocent.<br/><br/>Yes, it takes the bigger person to back down. Even if they were wrong, two wrongs don't make a right. Even leaders are people.<br/><br/>I don't comment on the right or wrong of the action even as much as the right to make a decision and change it upon more research, consultation, and defference to the use of force except where necessary.
We don't believe one party rule enables maximum productivity and this is a good example of how lack of competition of opinion cauterizes thinking.<br/><br/>We, Americans, will be more valuable as a people because of the broadcast and diversity of opinion and engagement of the population in debate and thinking and promotion and decay of ideas through evolutionary thinking.<br/><br/>Nothing to fear from the Chinese! They'll handicap themselves and we'll laugh at their inept attempts to be better by fiat.
We should be punishing Russia and China, not Syria. While they get a free hand in mischief making they'll keep supporting this war criminal until they feel pain. Economic pain of a serious kind IMHO.
At all costs we must hide the trust from those unable to understand it.

Ha! I founded a 400 person security company and I have no idea either... I listen to my CSO talk and immediately want to throw my laptop out the window! The human factor will get you every time.
Seems like a great playground for undercover work against Hezbollah and Iran. <br/><br/>Together with Israel we should be able to cause them both serious mischief. <br/><br/>In the mean time let's stay out of the actual Syrian conflict but support covert assassinations and unrest and keep Putin busy with his checkbook and focus.

Evolution has provided a 2 million year laboratory designed to allow men to maximize their ability to impregnate women. <br/><br/>You must all be insane to think that this is a "free" sex drive promoter. Still it may be worth death because, as I said, 2 million years of trying has made us die for sex.
It's very difficult for even internal departments that could make use of this data to get the tools necessary to make appropriate, legal, and effective decisions around individual's data. I'm sure if you ask most marketing departments they'll confirm the hurculean effort it takes to get it all wired together for internal use.<br/><br/>My own company has lots of data on people we do business with, but who decides under what format which datasets should be made available to whom. Who authenticates the owner, what about authentication of the owner's delagates who live in the same house of have merged datasets. What about access ability (Excel, word... not really democratic to require specific software or even a computer). Logging, subpoenas, backup etc etc... and all for what strategic value. It's just too expensive for little reward at this point.<br/><br/>Now if IBM's Watson wants to come along and gobble up everything everywhere and can tell me where my data is held that would be interesting.... 
Apple's executives work for Apples shareholders and not the US government. <br/><br/>Who gets to decide the moral code they're supposed to live up to! At least they obey the law which most lawmakers seem to have a hard time doing. <br/><br/>Good for them, if you're a shareholder, and good for them if you're a citizen, I'm not sure who's losing out here while their untaxed profits sit offshore.
Google "lawful intercept vulnerability" to really understand how easy it is to extract information from our society. It's no wonder we're hacked; we've created the moral hazard of leaving our riches unprotected for anyone to take!

The Constitution should be changeable to suit our circumstances and it should allow majority rational minds to create a more perfect future for all of us. <br/><br/>If it's not then where did all these amendments come from and are they all invalid ?

There are people who run legitimate businesses who spam people too.<br/><br/>I'm often on the receiving end of e-mails I don't want.

Christopher Hitchens says that Religion Poisons Everything. Is he right? Well the recent killing of coptic Christians in Egypt prove that hate among so-called religious still there and we don't really know where this problem is supposed to end. The arab spring really brought democracy or it is just another Muslim crusade to eliminate the non-muslims? The Egyptian people managed themselves to kick Mubarak out by expecting to have a true democracy. Guess what? They dug their own funeral hole. There is no democracy in this world. "democracy is the worst form of government except all the others that have been tried." (Winston Churchill). Why? Because the Devil can influence people's votes and plunge them into killing themselves.
Sounds like it's time to put this weiner between 2 buns and call it a day.
Destruction and chaos is a wonderful way to remember Trayvon Martin.  These people are so ridiculous that they would ruin the memory of a young man killed.   You are not honoring his memory by hurting others.  I blame all this on the media.  They started all of this months and months ago, it didn't have to go this far.  Stupid.
I'll bet his wife is so emotionally beat down by this egomanic that she can't leave him.  
I think we have already seen enough of this clown.  Are you kidding me?  
That is ridiculous.
The cops that work in schools are not retired.  They are active duty officers assigned to schools.  
I think that is what we have to do.  This and banning assault rifles should work, but if there is really a crazy person intent of doing something horrific...he will.  
I have experienced severe childhood truama.  In my thirties I decided to go see a therapist for my depression, "morbid depression" I was labeled.   We went through the trauma and I came out fine.  I am now in 53 been happy for years, and think people do not work hard enough to get themselves "right".  We rely on medicating people instead of helping them do the work.  I am no therapist but do know what can work.  How can someone be on antidepressant medication for years and years?  I'm not talking about bipolar or psychotic disorder.
It seems to me that more and more people everyday are suffering from "Narcissistic personality disorder ".  I don't remember so many people thinking they were so self important.  Just look at our Sports figures and Government Officicals.  People used to be humble.  What the heck happened?  Does society make people "catch" narcissistic personality disorder?  Have parents done something to their children?  We all know people who have this disorder.  We usually call them jerks, but are they sick?
Well it's about time.  Thanks for dragging your feet Mr. Bernanke.  Interesting this happens just prior to the presidential election...
Hmm, sounds like Mr. Obama thinks he thought this up all on his own.  Didn't this plan get implemented under the Bush administration?  What exactly has Mr. Obama done for any of us?  How many of us have either been or are unemployed with the promise creating more jobs?  How many of us have lost our homes because Mr. Obama thought it more important to partner with China regarding STREETLIGHTS of all things, then to come up with a plan to really help Americans who have worked hard save their homes from foreclosure?  Get this do nothing President out of office!

Get Obama out of office and you will see the unemployment rate dramatically drop.  Businesses are afraid to hire with Obama in office. I know I am.  He claims to have saved the auto industry...then wouldn't there be a ripple effect to the economy?  The unemployment has not been under 8 percent in 41 months, how long does it take Obama to turn things around?
Blame it on Obama.  His stupid "bail out" didn't help anyone.  I suspect the Banks think they dupped him and are hopeful he'll do it again before his term is up.  I think it's time we stop leaving everything up to Government and get more involved.  This is ridiculous and I for one am sick of it.
Obama probably didn't even know what was going on...he strikes me as that type of President.  He can't answer the questions because he is oblivious to what went on.  Obama needs to pay attention.  The Border Patrol officers shouldn't have to sacrifice their lives because of our President is too busy going to Sarah Parker's house instead of knowing what is going on under his Presidency.  Get him out of the White House!
America's healthcare has been taken over by the 1%ers.  They own us.  They write the rules, and have massive political backing with a never ending supply of money.  Just listen to the GOP go on and on about ObamaCare.  Their diatribes make NO sense, but that doesn't keep them from repeating the same nonsense.  Just now Jim Hensarling was on CNN, saying that ObamaCare was hurting the economy.   So better to close down government and therefore created jobs?  
We ARE terrorized here in America.  911 didn't bring us together.  Our politicians didn't make us brave and strong, they used our fear, and embellished it, and used our anxiety to SPEND MONEY.  <br/><br/>Can you imagine if Joe McCarthy had Mainway?

Pointless!  We never had a clear mission in Afghanistan after we got sidetracked into Iraq, Cheney and Company.

Americans are terrorized by our government and media.  We are led to believe that our country is threatened, and that everyone of us is in danger.  This is a LIE.  But it serves the super-rich to have us all believe that, and so the "security state" is here to stay.  We welcome big brother.  Our massive military, and militarized police are all heroes.  Those cameras, satellites, 1000 bases around the world, 2.5 million soldiers, millions of civilians in CIA, NSA, watching, listening, questioning, are keeping us safe, but be watchful... 
America is TERRORIZED.  We are scared, frightened, anxious.  We want big brother to take care of us, even though we have the largest military in the history of mankind.  75 nuclear submarines silently prowling the deep.  1000 bases around the world with 2.5 million soldiers armed and ready.  Thousands of airplanes, countless ships.  Satellites monitoring and watching.  And millions are employed in NSA, CIA, security agencies, and digging through data and sweeps looking for bad vibes.  And we have a gigantic militarized police forces, with more people behind bars than any country.  And we have "security" and security cameras and armed vigilantes in most cities who imagine they are keeping us safe.  No, there is no going back.  No politician can stand up and say, "We are the land of the brave, and we must stop this slide into paranoia."  
The case went on for over a decade.  That was the worst part of the mess in my opinion.  Blacks just didn't trust the legal system, and many still don't.  It is hard to tell truth from fiction.  JUst like the O. J. trial, and now Treyvon Martin.  Al Sharpton never backed down.  Al Sharpton's remarks, along with Maddox's and Mason's against Assistant DA Pagones cost them $345,000.  Sharpton allegedly did not pay his $65,000 fine, but others paid it for him.

The government should decriminalize marijuana.  Stay out of it.  Don't tax it and try to "regulate" it.  Once politicians get involved they just make a big mess of it.

What a ridiculous mess.  If we had a realistic mission in Afghanistan then "prisoners" would make sense.  But we don't, and we never have.
The NRA long ago became lobbyists for the gun and ammo merchants.  They don't care about people, or the 2nd amendment.  They care about the money.
What a joke.  America is "terrorized."  We have lost our ability to assess threats.  We no longer know what is real.  So we will spend our nations wealth, worrying now whether or not North Korea is going to commit national suicide by cop, by send a missile our way.
I think we should have a new big prize every year for the Most Moral Person of the Year.  Maybe they should be a dead person from the last year?  And we could look back on their whole lives, and their jobs, and family lives, and diets, and weight, and plastic surgeries, and how they behaved according to their religions, and of course their bad habits, and their love lives (of course), and their kinds, and how they were as parents, and how their kids turned out,... 
What about all of the musicians you love, and actors?  Why must athletes and school teachers, and cops be pure, when everyone else is doing Five Hour Energy drinks, Viagra, big coffees, and Wellbutrin, but no one blinks?  
Hans-Gunnar Liljenwall, a member of the Swedish modern pentathlon team, was stripped of his bronze medal at the Mexico City Olympics (1968) when he tested positive for excessive alcohol. Liljenwall said he had two beers to calm his nerves during the pistol shooting part of the pentathlon. He became the first athlete ever disqualified from the Olympic Games for doping, and the whole Swedish team was forced to return their medals as well. At the same Olympics, 14 other athletes tested positive for tranquilizers which were not banned at the time.
"In 1904 Olympics marathon runner, Thomas Hicks, was using a mixture of brandy and strychnine [a stimulant that is fatal in high doses] and nearly died. Mixtures of strychnine, heroin, cocaine, and caffeine were used widely by athletes and each coach or team developed its own unique secret formulae. This was common practice until heroin and cocaine became available only by prescription in the 1920s."  Mark S. Gold, MD  Performance-Enhancing Medications and Drugs of Abuse, 1992
The whole world is addicted to performance enhancing drugs.  What do you think Viagra is?  What about Five Hour Energy shots?   If you don't think that player, throughout all the years of baseball, would try ANYTHING that was offered to them to consume, that was supposed to improve their performance, then you are sorely mistaken.
This is the primary reason that I stopped watching NBC and MSNBC!  They consistently make incendiary comments,  and many times they are not supported by even the flimsiest of facts.   I guess to some MSNBC is an alternative to FOX,  but it seems to most viewers that FOX is a paragon of virtue when compared to MSNBC.   It appears MSNBC with their screaming,  attacking,  and demeaning is more like RUSH,  and I can only take so much of him.   We need to pull together as a nation and with this kind of stuff continually on the airwaves it is going to be hard.
I was a Republican for 30 years and changed to Independent a couple of years ago because of Bush's endless wars.  I have always believed the Republican party cared about the middle class.  I was wrong!   The Ryan budget proves one thing.   They one care about corporations,  the rich,  and the elite in this country.   On morning Joe today I heard the comment that no amount of means testing could solve the Medicare issues.   This is a flat lie.   The upper middle class and the rich love their free health care and they want to keep it.   They do not want to pay more nor do they want their taxes increased to protect the poor or help the middle class never mind it was the middle class for the last 70 years that has indirectly paid more than their fair share.   The money that was to go into to medicare and social security was going into the general fund.  For the most part it was the people who made under $100,000 that was paying the lions share for Social Security.  So I think it is reasonable to argue the middle class has paid more than they were suppose to pay in taxes the last 60-70 years.   Medicare and Social Security can solve their problems easily through means testing.   Here is the formula:    First,   Means test Social Security.    Second,   All income over $108,000 is subject to an additional 4% Social Security tax.  This would be in addition to the means testing.  Third,  Medicare would be means tested.    Fourth,   those with incomes and savings that provide them more than $250,000 per year would pay full premium for medicare and their deductible would be $15,000 for part A and $7,500 for Part B.   Those with incomes in retirement of $100,000 to $250,000 would have a $10,000 ded for part A and a $5,000 for part B.   Those with incomes of $50,000 to $100,000 in retirement would have a $5,000 Part A and a $2,500 for part B.   Those with incomes of less than $50,000 in retirement would pay based on a graduating scale,  but only the poorest would enjoy the current situation of only $150 ded for part B.   I don't want to hear any garbage about Medicare and Social Security not working.  The problem is the upper middle class,  the rich,  and the elite want their taxes low and they want all their government goodies as well.   Currently,  all these talking heads on TV make millions of dollars and none of them want to pay additonal Social Security taxes or have their benefits means tested nor do their want to pay the full premium for Medicare and have a high ded for part A and B,  but that is exactly what needs to happen.   This is exactly the way it should have been set up to begin with.    It was a crime for Roosevelt to allow the rich to draw Social Security but not to pay for it on their entire earnings.   This talk of raising the age of retirement is a NON-STARTER..........Yes people are living longer,  but they are not necessarily healthier.   All we would do if we increase the age is force more people to file disability.   It is time we woke up and changed these policies to suit the situation.   Medicare part A and B for the rich should essentially be a major medical plan.    Medicare part A and B for those making 50-100 should have a sizable ded. and only for the retired poor should medicare be as it is currently today.   Any talk of a voucher system designed to keep future costs down to protect the rich, elite and those in the upper tax brackets is a non-starter.   Americans are waking up to the fact that most of our countries problems started with the tax reductions of 1980.   The great Presidency of Ronald Reagan has bankrupted this country!    We need to put our house in order,   but we are not going to do it by continuing Social Security checks for the rich.   Nor by allowing the rich to protect their full income from Social Security or the rich reaping the benefits of Medicare and not paying the full premium.   THE TIME HAS ARRIVED AND THE WEALTHY HAS TO START PAYING FOR THEIR PERKS!!!!!!!!!!!!  
What I am going to say is going to sound harsh,  but I believe it is the only hope we have to deal with this third world terrorism.   We survived and thrived during the cold war because of a simple concept of mutually assured destruction.   Both sides understood that if either side launched their nuclear armaments it would mean both countries and probably the world would be destroyed.   Currently,   we have dozens of small countries that are allowing terrorist inside their borders because they believe and support the very things those terrorists are fighting for.   At the same time these countries are giving us lip service,  excepting our money,  minimal help and support.   They aren't really in an all out war to root out these terrorists.   It simply is not in their interest to do so.  Imagine this scenario.   There are 1,000 Americans traveling the globe butchering arabs,  blowing up middle easter property and generally committing carnage and mayhem.   Do  you think such a thing could happen anywhere in the world?   No it could not because no one in the world is going to financially support,  sympathize with,  or shelter any American engaged in terrorism.   These terrorists have dozens of countries and millions of people who will either help them or turn a blind eye to their behavior.   Even in European countries they are allow to stand on the street corner and preach their hate without impunity.   So what is the answer.    Anything less than a strategy similar to the cold war strategy will not work.   We have to treat countries and communities that harbor and help these people as our enemies and take them down.   We have to announce to the world that if a nuclear, biological,  or chemical weapon is detonated in our country we will find out the nationality of the people ultimately behind the disaster and that country will pay.   That means countries like Saudi Arabia will have to stop allowing their schools,  and religious institutions to preach and teach hate.   Countries like Iran,  Pakistan,  Syria etc. will be told the first time we are attacked if their people are involved they will be attacked.  No more giving them money which they turn around and give to the terrorists.   TIME TO GET TUFF!   Better we do it now before the disaster occurs.   The American people will not stand for it when it comes so you have better start making the necessary changes NOW!  
The Democrats mishandled Health Reform!    They determined to impose a nationwide system of health care regardless of how angry it made the American people.   They did this without Republican support and only about 35% of the American people in agreement.   The first time in 60 years that a program, of this significance, was foisted on the country without the other party being involved and without the support of the people.  Democrats came to the conclusion they had a veto proof Senate and regardless of the horrible economy were going to push the bill through.   They succeeded in imposing their will,  but now comes the payback for this ill conceived plan.  I do not believe,  in the final analysis,  the American courts are prepared to pass on this bill, considering the above facts.   It is going to come down to one Supreme Court Judge!   I just can't see the court allowing a small minority to determine 1/6 of the economy, when it involves such a contentious issue.   The best thing the Democrats could do is sit down at the table with Republicans and rework the entire thing before this reaches the Supremes.   I don't think the Democrats want to have the 2012 election shortly after a negative ruling of Health Care. 
Two weeks ago on another site I predicted Keith Olbermann would get fired in 2011!  I am alittle surprised it happened so quickly.   However, this guy was revolving around some galaxy many light years from this one.   This simple fact is this guy was killing NBC and for that matter all of network news.   Multiplied millions have stopped watching all programming on the big three because ABC, NBC, CBS have become megaphones for the left.   This guy and all the network new divisions are dragging down their networks regular programming.   People are infuriated with the slanted and steady diet of distorted news they are getting to the point FOX has become the only source of news for half the country.   It is way past time for the major news outlets to clean house.   The news divisions should for the most part reflect the market.   People are paying good money for CNN, and MSNBC,  Fox,  and they have a right to expect some semblance of fairness.   ABC has illustrated how far off the deep end they have fallen with their acquisition for their Sunday morning line up.   They had a powerful middle-of-the road newsman in Jake Tapper and they chose to go outside and get another reporter off the deep end.   People are just totally fed up with this foolishness and are canceling newspaper subscriptions,  and turning off CNN and the big three.   I predict CHANGES ARE COMING!   
I have never read an article more foolish or one I disagree with more than this silly article.  To suggest the country went to the polls, not even ten days ago, and in one of the most historic elections, threw out 64 Democrats from the house and then to suggest the people didn't really want to do this is, at the least, hair brained!  This kind of thinking is going to hurt the Democrats in the next election.   It seems to go along with the other nonsense we hear coming from Democrats like;  the electorate is stupid,  uneducated,  care only about their guns and bibles,  didn't understand what we were doing.   The American people know exactly what is going on in this country and they didn't approve of most of it.   If the Democrats continue to lie to themselves they are going to face an even worse disaster in the next election.   The American people hate pelosi and reed,  they want smaller government,  they want a balanced budget,  taxes kept to a minimum,  congress to work together and compromise on solving the social security and medicare issues.  Most of all they want congress to revisit health care and craft a truly bi-partisan bill.   If two years pass and non of these things get worked on there will be more Democrats and maybe Republicans shown the exit. 
Nancy Pelosi may have done a great job!   And she may be remembered as a powerful and successful Speaker!  However,   she seems to be in a state of total delusion.   This is the only the second time in my life that the Democrats have allowed themselves to become totally deluded.   Jimmy Carter was in a state of delusion and from his recent comments he still is.  Now we have Barach Obama who seems to be a carbon copy of Carter.  He is operating in a state of delusion.   He constantly attacks his own Democrats and Republicans when the American people want him to LEAD!!!   That means stop attacking and take responsiblity and work to make things better.   Are you capable of making things better?  I am beginning to wonder.
Too little to late!    He always has to increase taxes or take away tax breaks from someone in order to fund one of his pet projects.   He Never Cuts Anything!   That is why we are in desperate shape in this country.
It needs fixed Now!
I am conservative and not opposed to playing politics  but in this case we need to fix the problem and not the blame.   After the problem is fixed and cleaned up we can point fingers.   Personally,   I would like the President to give this the kind of seriousness he would give a Chernobyl like accident!!!!!  I wish he would call a meeting Tuesday morning at the White house and bring the brightest minds from the four corners of the globe to bear on this issue.   Tell the Navy beginning today the spill is their problem!!  Working with BP they are to stop the leak ASAP and clean the mess up and this is a NUMBER ONE NATIONAL AGENDA!    NOTHING LESS WILL DO.    We can't sit  back for the next 3-4 four months and watch BP play the American people like they are doing.    This disaster has to be handled and it has to be handled NOW nomatter what the cost!
People are sick of the one sided news reporting and you get a load of it on CNN!   They just don't want to change.   Most of the networks losing money won't move away from the liberal model even tho people are sick of it and even tho it is costing them money.   So they can send their message out into the ethos with no one watching.
I use to watch CNN much more than I do now.   I rarely watch any news programs and when I do I watch FOX.  I am weary with the one sided reporting and I think the majority of Americans feel the same way.   I really do not like one sided reporting.   I am sickened by what I see on MSNBC.   CNN needs to be totally down the middle and it needs to be much more combative.   Democracy is a combat sport!   Democracy is a war with bloodshed.   CNN seems to think they can pretend to be middle of the road but they are anything but middle of the road.   Middle of the road means you have guests arguing all sides of an issue and the monitors aren't all liberal in their politics.   CNN needs to get with the program.   If they continue the way they are they will cease to be a force in American news. 
For the first time in a long, long time I actually felt good about the two rulings that came out today by the Supreme Court.   I actually thought they finally "got it".    It isn't about some dead document or some political agenda it is about "us".     What is best for "our" country.    Finally,   somebody has started doing something that was good for our country.     
The last thing this country needs is another lying Senator!   Please with the problems our country faces we do not need lied to we need politicians who have the guts to speak the truth.   This fellow has a basic character flaw and that is another thing we don't need another Senator with major character flaws.   When are we going to wake up in this country!
As a conservative republican I would like to see a moderate appointed to the supreme court.   I am not naive enough to think that is going to happen.   Considering the choices Obama put forward to pick from I think this Kagan woman is as good as any.   I think it is a mistake to make a big fight over this pick.   We need to stay focused on the election.   Attacking this woman would only seem narrow and unwarranted by the American people.   Right now Republicans are in a position to gain seats in the fall an attack on Elena Kagan could not help our position in the fall.   In fact,   I think it is not in the best interests of either party to fight over the supreme court pick this summer.   People are in a angry state of mind and there is no way to know exactly how the American people would react to attacks regarding a Supreme court pick.   My advice let her go onto the court without any fanfare.   
If your logic is correct would you apply it to John F. Kennedy or how about Robert Kennedy.   How about applying your distorted logic to Martin Luther King Jr.   Maybe you have heard the axiom that goes,  "that which proves to much proves nothing."   Such is the case with your proofs regarding moral behavior and particular members of society.   People act out for a lot of reasons and many of those reasons have little to do with morals.   Sometimes they are a reflection of the tremendous amounts of stress certain people put themselves under.   Then again some of us just compartmentalize our lives.   Whatever I am growing very tired of the media types drawing to much from a 32 year old billionaire acting out in mid-life.    He is not a politician!    Please get out of his life and just leave him alone and give the rest of us a little rest. 
This is not the USSR despite what the Democrats think!   Come November we intend to show them what we think.   They are going to pay and pay dearly for betraying the American people 
As a lifetime Republican I am going to be very very disappointed if my fellow Republicans don't get totally behind these reforms.   This is the kind of bill I think has been needed for a very long time.   Republicans should oppose the President when he is wrong  but when he is right they should get on board.   In the case of this education bill he is absolutely right.   REPUBLICANS SHOULD FAST TRACK THIS BILL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
I am an Independent.   I voted for Barach Obama!    However,   I do not approve of highhanded tactics to overrule the American people.   I think if the Democrats do this it will be a catastrophe for Democrats on par with what watergate was for Republicans.
This is the first article I have read about Health care that I have agreed with.   I think first if they want this thing to pass they will have to change the name and call it something other than Health Care legislation.  In addition,   your ideas to keep costs down are super but I don't think the Democrats will ever buy into it.  You know if the Democrats hadn't gone into this thing with the attitude of take it or leave it and we are goin get all we can get and included Republicans from the beginning and especially if Obama had had the guts to take on the Lawyers from the beginning we would have a bill right now.   Here we are a year later and his presidency is on the line and he still won't take on the lawyers.   It is too bad but bi-partisanship always seems to be directed at the Republicans by the media,   but I see little or none of it from Democrats.   Our whole country is in sad shape because we need to get away from political parties and start getting pragmatic before it is too late.  However,  having said that I am furious that the Democrats have wasted two years messing with this at a time when we need some many other things done.
Like most Americans I am just worn out with this foolishness!   I don't understand how we have a president who goes on national television asking for bipartisanship the very day he releases a bill that epitomizes that very thing.     He knows how sick the country is of this issue!   He knows we are practically bankrupt!   He knows that the majority of Americans are against this bill!   And yet he persists!   I just don't understand when he only has six months to get legislation passed before the election to try and get his party out of the deep hole they have dug for themselves and he goes back and starts again on what appears a losing issue.   I do sympathize with the President he came so close,   but you just can't do things of this magnitude without the support of the American people.   I don't see these skittish congressman passing something like this.   I can't imagine how damaging it will be to the Democrats if they were to spend the next 6 months arguing over this bill.   I am 60 years old and this is the first time I have ever seen a political party risk so much so close to an election.,
The Democrats really have no one to blame for this but themselves.   Bayh has been pretty well and he had a better than average chance of winning.   The moderates in the Senate are sick and tired of this extreme liberalism and the chronic bickering it is causing in our country.   The simple fact is the people do not support Obama and the liberal Democrats and their agenda.   It appears against the will of the people they are going to try and use reconciliation to ram it down our throat which result in nothing short of an all out war.    Democrats are going to continue losing some of their best if they persist in this hopeless and hapless path they have chosen.
I am reluctant to give Haiti any money until they turn those baptists loose!    We are spending billions helping them and they lock up 10 people trying to help them.   I don't believe for a minute those 10 people were trying to market those children.

Obama is not up for election so why should he compromise!   After all he is not the one who is going to have to go home at the end of this year.   His career will not end at the end of 2010.   You can bet the speech he gave tuesday night would have been substantially different if he was up for reelection.   That is why he is a total hippocrite!   Frankly,   he intends to push his bogus socialist agenda as long as he can.   So we can expect, one degree or another,  the same issues that have infuriated the American people will be shoved down our throats between now and the fall.   Of course,   you can be certain the speech he gives next January will be quite contrite.   It won't do him any good.   The American people see him for what he is;  a arrogant,  self-involved,  promoter who doesn't understand the people of this country or really care about them.   Expect his party to fall and afterward the demise of the great one.    
I must say how surprised  I am by the negativity toward Ms Gilbert and Eat Pray Love. She's a writer who went on a very interesting journey paid for by a publisher and then wrote about it,  How pathetic the nasty envy for a balanced, happy extremely generous, honest human being. Such petty thinking.  Isn't a wealthy, independent woman allowed to have her story and write about it. Lighten up people. And those who never read it, do not judge the book by the movie. 
Elizabeth Gilbert is a joy to read, listen to and think about. Her understanding and openess about  the mystery of life give such comfort. . As John Keats wrote, "a thing of beauty is a joy forever," and Elizabeth has created that in herself and her work.  Humans will be reading her encouragement of existence always. I thank her very much for sharing herself so. Her words and being help me.
Consciousness exists in many dimensions.  
The Mayor needs to slip into a Twilight Zone episode where he is poor and a minority and is constantly stopped and frisked wherever he goes. Then he may have empathy for the horror of this policy. 
Stop and frisk is  a very dangerous risk to basic American laws of this land. Dangerous neighborhoods need more surveillance, but the stop and frisk policy goes against America's civil law principle, and we must guard against abuse of any kind by not allowing it. In airports they announce what we are subject to, so we know what to expect, but in front of people's residences, walking in the neighboorhood, no. We must protect our rights no matter what the nighborhood. The police just must walk the beat and hope they see a crime in progress, or very, very suspicious activity. Stopping and talking, yes, stopping and frisking an invasion of privacy.
Marvelous column, Maureen.  Recently I watched the movie, The Shoes of the Fisherman from 1968, and remembered how when the Russian Pope puts  up all the Church's wealth to save the Chinese people from starvation and avoid a world war. If only the Catholic chruch truly lived by the true teaching of Jesus, to love thy neighbor as thyself, to live simply.  The Catholic Church will have to change as the world is changing, communicating, discovering the truth of one humanity all trying to survive on this planet.
Yes, leaps of faith can take us to the most rewarding places. Luckily for Don Quixote, he just found himself in the meadows. Too many have to actaully fight the serpents and lizards in the the black bog in order to get through to the beauty. Like sane people have to fight through the Republican leadership of the house.
Thank you for writing about Mr. Meyers.  The love surrounding him, his love of life and his acceptance of losing such precious mementos with grace. I agree with him so on one needs a bed, clean underwear and a shower to be able to face life everyday with enthusiasm. I especially love the three glasses of wine a day.
Dear Dick,<br/><br/>Among all the horror and sadness in the world today, your essay is truly a pleasure to read. I'm so glad you made it aboard and shared with us your harrowing experience. You are a treasure Mr. Cavett. You did deserve an audience for your leap, and the ship should never have left without you
I still am baffled by the number of votes Romney won. How could ignorance be so close in a race against truth and  intelligent scientific facts of life? We, the winners of further enlightenment, must continue to fight for truth. We must help those who are born into ignorance have access to education to learn facts that support humans continuing on this exquisite planet.  In scientific earth time, humans have only been here for two seconds on a trwenty-four hour clock. I sure hope we make it to at least five seconds before we wipe ourselves out. There is hope.
Thank you for writing about this. I spoke of Rubio's statement at Thanksgiving dinner. We must never let up on ignorance trying to be truth. Science is what is by repeated experiment and study. Religion are stories by men that may be inspired by God, but they're not truth, just faith. Scientific proof must always be taught in schools.
Ego, ego, ego and boredom, boredom, boredom, even for Generals, and heads of  the CIA, and some past presidents.  Yes, sex and envy make people stupid, but.... the aforementioned is really what it is about. 
The House Republicans will be watched very carefully. Balking at helping fix the problems of the country rationally, will send them further and further into the fanatical fringe. Then, hopefully, the country will give the Democrats the ability to fix with logic and sacrifice of all understood, win both houses and make the country strong and fiscally responsible once again.. 
Good writing, but the ridiculous description of the President is really pathetic.  He's energized by the truth and that many, such as, Powell, Christie and Bloomberg realize the future of America in reality is no phantom theory anymore. We have no control over the weather and we better take the climate seriously, as well as human and women's rights. We need a brilliant, rational, compassionate President, and they acknowledged it finally.  I believe the President is going to win, and it will be so wonderful to have Romney disappear back into his hypocritical, stand for nothing, life.
Those are commendable pro-life causes that Mayor Bloomberg has instigated, but what about stop and frisk, and allowing male police officers to frisk females. An innocent woman being frisked against her will by men because she is a minority is a form of molestation so horrific,.. well, it is right up there with the thinking of Akin, Mourdock, and Walsh. Mayor Bloomberg is not giving those women a right to choose.
Sorry, Maureen, but I think you have done your sister Peggy a real disservice by telling us how backward and, yes, stupid she is to think about voting for a known liar like Romney that stands for nothing, and a vice presidential candidate that thinks a just fertalized egg is a human being.  It would be hard for me to have any respect for a sister like that. 
Your column is the most perfect explanation of the Romney/Ryan platform. Extreme lies to go along with their extreme idiology. Two very scary men who will say anything to gain power. It terrorizes me that  there are so many who believe them. Thank you.
Oh, Maureen, how can you bear the thought of a Romney/Ryan win?  They want to control women's bodies like the Taliban. The thought that there are so many people willing to give up the freedoms that women and minorities around the world have fought for by voting for these two close minded men scares me more than Bush Cheney and look at the hell they' put us through. President Obama is a brilliant, honest, decent, caring man who has devoted his life to public service and the other two are self serving white men that don't deserve the office they seek. I will be heartsick and despondent if R&amp;R win, and I'll volunteer the next day at Planned Parenthood.  Maybe I'll do that anyway, because President Obama must win.
I was very disappointed in President Obama's lack of attack at all of Mitt Romney's lies. However, Mitt Romney lied throughout, just his delivery was good. I'm hoping that conservatives will be so shocked at last night's performance by fake Democrat Mitt Romney, they won't vote for him now
Fat bullying has been going on and on and on. However, as much as I realize that there is an obesity epidemic, the constant discussion of the negativity of being overweight will give people an excuse to bully. I don't believe anyone chooses to be fat. Study after study show that overweight bodies crave food the way an alcoholic's body craves liquor. Yes, some people are much stronger than others and can fight the urge to eat successfully. Food addiction is the most prevalent addiction that shows on the human body. We must be very careful how we stigmatize overweight children, or life will become even more unbearable from the cruelty. 
I think, Maureen, you hope Romney does win, so you'll have more to write about that makes sense when you castigate a President. President Obama's speech did not in any way blame the people. He was saying that the problems were so enormous, and the Republicans so bent on his destruction that it is taking longer to solve them, and he needs four more years to make sure we stay on the right course to make this happen. Romney and Ryan will set the country back to the fifties in ignorance and lack of tolerance.  I understand your need for controversy, but I don't believe you believe what you're writing. 
No, President Obama is protecting a woman's right  to protect and govern her own body.  I'm positive the President wants it to be safe, legal and RARE, just like anyone else with common sense. But, it must remain the woman's decision.
I'm so glad, Maureen, that you are stating the scary truth about Romney and Ryan. Comparing Mitt to President Obama is truly as bizarre to me as the question, 'Did you bring your lunch or did you walk to work.' No sense at all. President Obama is running for America, not just his base. He wants to protect us from the right wing terrorizing zealots of the Republican party, and I do think that men who want to control women's bodies the way Ryan really does is on the road to Taliban thinking.  And Romney choosing such a man is on the same level as McCain picking Palin, pathetic. Anything to win, but a good excuse if they lose.<br/><br/>The President has kept America going.... no we are not out of the woods, but he said over and over when he was running in 2008 that it was a long road ahead for recovery and he has kept us on the right track.  <br/><br/>.
Venus and Serena are very nearly perfect in their tennis, manners, truth and fineness.  Their parents raised two normal yet brilliant women.  I agree they should never go back to Indian Wells. Thank you, Venus and Serena for giving us so much pleasure and excitement.  
Romney, Ryan, Cheney, W represent the white male and many a white female that are terrorized of losing control in this country. They are not willing to accept the changes of a country and world, and especially the climate.  It staggers me that after all the history of this planet, the obvious truths of science and evolution we allow ignorance to rule so many humans just born into it... and through constant communication, the ability for ignorance to be accepted in the media as truth.  Two men are running for office that have no empathy for the struggle of life for so many. They only want the status quo of the few having it all, the wealth and the power. I have to believe that intelligence, belief in the truth as proven by repeated situations through time will get us through the ignorance and selfishness of the now republican party.  A true and rational essay, Maureen. 
Giving up freedom to obtain security leads to no freedom and no security.  Just look at where our future government is headed, e.g.  North Korea, China, Saudi Arabia, England, Israel, Russia etc<br/><br/>Those people gave up freedom for security.  We are becoming a third world country.<br/><br/>Freedom is not free, many Americans have died for the freedoms we enjoyed and are presently being squandered,  where no brave statesmen in government stands up for the people.<br/><br/>-- Tomas Jeffereson

Our minds have limited intellect.  We will never conceptually understand the very fundamentals of everything.  We need to accept that and be humbled by it.  We probably exist in a multi-dimensional universe that may have an infinite number of  dimensions. The most a human mind can understand conceptually are 4 dimensions.  Any other explanations above 4 no matter how cleverly explained by mathematical symbols, string theory, multiverse, or space warping onto itself  is just a laughing stock.  Can you teach an ant crossing your table in the morning the concepts of calculus.  No matter how many different crumbs or pieces of sugar you lay out even given an googleplex of time, you will not be able to instruct the ant on the concepts of calculus.  The ant will never understand the concepts of a derivative or integral.  Well that's how our minds are when we go above four dimensional thinking.

It's long past time that Israel stop hand-wringing about Iran. Iran's leaders have made clear their intent to destroy Israel, some eagerly extending it to killing all Jews. Okay, that's what they want. They're trying to build nukes. So need to wait, not even one more day. Israel should announce that because Iran has declared its intent to destroy Israel, Israel is declaring war against Iran and will not just impede their nuclear work, but attack with every weapon at their disposal to destroy as much of Iran as is possible, leaving a lifeless shell behind. That's what war has always been about. Israel should give Iran a day or so to retract their threats. If not retracted, bombs away. Iran will deserve whatever consequences attend to their openly stated intent to wipe Israel off the map. 
Any black who dares to be other than party line Democrat is smeared by Democrats/Leftists/Progressives as an Uncle Tom, as 'not legitimately African American', as a sell-out (e.g., Clarence Thomas, Herman Cain, Allen West, Artur Davis, Condolezza Rice, etc. etc.). But Republicans do not smear the 97% of blacks who obediently vote straight line Democrat as Uncle Toms for their Democratic Party masters, nor are they slammed as not real African Americans.<br/><br/>This proves beyond reasonable doubt that it is Democrats who are obsessed with race, and deem that one is only worthy of being granted the 'African American' label if one has beliefs that Democrats approve of. That, my friends, is racism of the first order. 
A better question: Is there any reason to negotiate with or provide a single dollar of aid, drop of water, or morsel of food to Arabs who daily shriek 'kill all Jews' and 'Death to America". Of course not. Let them drink their hate, eat their hate, feed their 'children' hate until they dry up and blow away.
How come Rosenthal and commenters fail to remind us who was the world's first 'birther'? Yes, a nasty, racist, ignorant fool, to be sure. Someone named Barack Hussein Obama, the very person who wrote on his agent and publishers bio way back before he was famous, that he was born in Kenya and his father was Minister of Finance there. Yes, he did correct these lies...17 years later, when he started running for President. Since we know Obama was born in Hawaii, why in the world would he spout the vile 'birther lie' that he was born in Kenya, and factually be the 'father' of birthism. <br/><br/>Word is out that it's because he applied to universities as a foreign student, perhaps to get certain valuable financial assistance limited to foreign students. Only by releasing his school records can Obama prove that he did not fraudulently apply as a foreign student, as he proudly proclaimed for years in his bio.
Amazing how all the replies to Jeff's comment defend Joe Wilson. When he collaborated with the NYT to write his article, natural questions arose 'who is this guy?' and 'who sent him to Niger?', where apparently he lounged around the pool, having no experience with the country, and somehow used his alcohol-fueled frolicking in the sun to make claims re what Iraq was trying to do re Niger. When it came out that his wife was involved in sending him, that she had an anti-Bush chip on her shoulder, and she was not in any manner a current undercover CIA operative, but an office worker who drove to the CIA every day. Yeah, some 'undercover' agent. Maybe she was at one time, but certainly not at the time of the scandal. Proof? Fitzgerald prosecuted nobody for releasing the name of a 'covert agent'.  All he did was entrap Libby for forgetting, when Fitzgerald already knew who mentioned Plame, one of Colin Powell's 'moderate' lackies, and that it was not a criminal disclosure. But to the NYT and its commenters, anything leftists do is right and proper, and anyone who opposes leftists is evil. The stupidity of the people here, reflecting block-head reasoning, never ceases to amaze.
To david st. clair. Okay, you're right. Not every Kennedy was a mysogynist sleazeball. But check your history. Rape, child molestation (okay, it was an early teen baby sitter), philandering (you're really arguing that this never happened among Kennedy Catholics?), and yes, Ted Kennedy committed at least manslaughter in his drunk driving, fleeing scene of Mary Joe Kopechne's death. And not to forget the belief by many in the know that the Kennedy's were responsible for the death of Marilyn Monroe.<br/><br/>And, yes, Bill Clinton was not only accused of rape, but of aggrevated rape by Juanita Broderick, who gave a detailed recitation of his brutal assault, which culminated in him biting her lip. Candy Crowley nervously brought this up one time, then dutifully let it slide, as did the NYT and other MSM. Perhaps that's why you falsely believe Clinton was NEVER accused. Was he guilty? Who knows, since he was NEVER questioned about Broderick's charges and her claim that Hillary subsequently pressed her to keep her mouth shut.<br/><br/>So SHAME ON YOU, Clair! At least get your facts partially right.
One should consider the source when Dems accuse Republicans of waging a 'war on women' and are 'women haters'. Sure, Akin is an idiot and should have withdrawn. But I hope Republicans remind Americans about the multiple women who said Bill Clinton raped, molested, exposed himself to them. And Americans should recall that 'women' like Boxer, Hillary, Wasserman Schultz and countless other self-proclaimed feminists defended Clinton, thus are factually pro rape as long as the rapist is a liberal democrat. So perhaps we should differentiate between 'actual rape' and 'rape by Democrat', the later by definition not rape. <br/><br/>Then we've got Democratic Party hot shot, John Edwards, a cruel, vicious treater of women whom the Democratic Party women drooled over. And who can forget the archetype Democrats, those Kennedy rascals. With few exceptions, every Kennedy clan male was a rapist, child molester, philanderer, and/or engaged(es) in countless other acts of abuse of women.<br/><br/>And who could forget Hollywood, Rap Musicians and self-proclaimed political satirists like Maher, who use the most degrading terms for women whose political views vary from leftist dogma. No word of protest from Boxer or Wasserman Schultz or Sandra Fluck or any other self-proclaimed determiners of whom is pro and who is anti women.<br/><br/>I hope Republicans have every woman raped or otherwise assaulted by a prominent Dem or Dem supporter hold court during the Dem convention, and show what a real war on women is like.
Wake up, 'young citizen'. It is Obama that has refused to meet with or compromise with Republican congressional leaders. He acts like a Dictator. The fool's so-called budgets have garnered precisely zero votes in Congress. None from Dems, none from Reps. He know virtually nothing about anything except how to win elections, having benefited from affirmative action, to the harsh detriment of our country. How can you possibly think the idiot in the White House is 'for the people' when he hasn't met with his Jobs Council in at least half a year, and won't even provide the few bucks necessary to get his impoverished brother in Kenya out from his slum shack. The guy had to get 1k from D'Nesh DeSouza for needed medical care. Guess Obama was too busy spending yet another 6k on a lavish shirt for Michelle.
Krugman is a hyperpartisan Democratic Party propogandist. Therefore, nothing he says about the Newsweek article can be considered truthful beyond their constituting the latest Democratic Party talkng points.
To E.G.,<br/>
The Pakistani Doctor who helped us identify Bin Laden was arrested by Pakistan and will probably be executed or murdered in jail, because Obama's blabbermouths spilled this top secret info. How many others have died or will refuse to cooperate with us because Obama has divulged virtually every secret in our war against Islamists (e.g., the Stuxnet reveal; methods galore). Elevate Valerie Plame if you wish, but it's obvious that the NYT collaborated with her husband to publish an article that lied about his own findings, and then you and your ilk shrieked with rage when people asked the obvious questions: who the hell is this guy  splashing at least partial lies across the NYT opinion page (he did find that Iraq did try to acquire yellow cake), why was he sent to Iraq, and by whose orders. It certainly wasn't Cheney. If there was any concern about protecting Plame's identity, this is hardly the way to do it, and suggests more likely a conspiracy between Plame, her husband, and the NYT leftists to destroy Bush.
The main thrust of this group of Seals is that Obama has divulged military and security secrets, intending to make him look like some kind of warrior. If I recall, the NYT had dozens of front page headlines and commenters were daily red-faced with rage and hatred toward Bush for 'unmasking a CIA operative', which they didn't (she was a CIA office worker in DC, openly known to work for them), whom even the Special Prosecutor didn't  find was any undercover operator. Yet anyone who dares protest Obama and his gang of thugs releasing high level secrets about methods and operations that surely endanger American lives is smeared as some sort of 'evil monsters' by the NYT and the same formerly red-faced commenters.
Reading all these comments about how Hezbollah is a viable political organization that warrants respect, even though they call for destroying Israel and killing all Jews, will the same commenters demand understanding of the KKK in America, and call for blacks to deal respectfully with the KKK and perhaps welcome them opening a large headquarters on 125th Street? And the KKK doesn't even call for the extermination of blacks. But call for killing Jews just because they're Jews...hey, lighten up. No problem. Probably their fault. 
Here's an alternative to stop and frisk, that so many minorities castigate. End all Section 8 housing support for other than the elderly, the recently unemployed, and the handful of truely disabled. Evict immediately all non-working, all single mothers on welfare, all families where anybody has committed a crime of theft or violence. Then end all welfare giveaways to these same non-contributors. Then use the saved money to hire trained private militias to police the city streets so ordinary people can walk, work, and life safely. 
Obama has no viable economic plan. Zero members of Congress voted for whatever nonsense he proposed. The Democratic Party that controls the Senate have refused to vote for any budget during Obama's term. But more than 240 in the House voted for and passed Ryan's budget., which like all economic bills passed by the House, Senate leader Reid refused to let come up for a vote. <br/><br/>Any one whose mind isn't addled can see that Obama and the Senate Democrats are the extremists re economic matters and the budget. Saying Romney/Ryan are 'extremists' is the NYT and Democrats engaging in Orwellian double-talk. <br/><br/>Anyone who listened this weekend to Debbie Wasserman Shultz and Rachel Maddow embarrass themslves with mindless talking-point talk talk while discussing Medicare, which Obama's crowd wants to slash in favor of the dependent crowd, could see who the serious persons in the room are, and they'r sure not the likes of the slash and burn leftists.
'Supposed' ties to Islamist extremists??? Huma's father, mother, and only sibling (brother) are major players in Muslim Brotherhood and similar Islamist organizations. Given that she's someone whose entire family are Islamists, it would be ludicrous to not investigate what the hell's going on there. Especially since Abedin married an important Jewish politician, and is supposedly influencing Secretary of State Clinton re Middle East matters. No way Abedin can get a security clearance unless via nefarious means, given her family connections.
Get some facts before you speak. It is Obama that is slashing 700 Billion from TODAY's Medicare recipients so he can give handouts to the gimme gimme gimme crowd. Republicans want to allow ALL CURRENT Medicare recipients and those over 55 to get Medicare exactly as it is today. <br/><br/>The program must be changed for younger Americans, as Ryan/Romney argue, to preserve medical support for them when they get older. The Obama/WassermanShultz plan is to keep everything the same forever, and watch dumfounded when, as predicted, Medicare goes bankrupt in 12 years. <br/><br/>Yes, 12 years. That's your cherished Democrats for you. Push current Medicare recipients off the cliff so their young, dependent class voters can get free or virtually free rides..for a few years. Then, nothing. Yeah, Obama! Yes we can! Whoohoo!.
Actually, Obama de facto apologized for America numerous times abroad, whether or not he used that precise word. A rose by any other name...<br/><br/>And yes, Obama did make the precise disparaging remarks and more about business people that Romney said he did. So now saying something means you didn't say it? Only if Obama is functionally illiterate, not able to match single with single, plural with plural. Is Krugman arguing that Obama spoke in an illiterate manner.<br/><br/>And perhaps Krugman might be intellectually honest enough to specify that the Tax Policy Center is a hard left institution, using their own leftist assumptions, not Romney's, meaning nothing they conclude can be taken at face value.<br/><br/>So it seems that the fraudulent one here is none other than Krugman, as usual.
It's funny to read the NYT and Democratic Party supporters (99% of those permitted to post here) whining with fake outrage about Kochs, Adelson, whomever. But never a word about the greedy Hollywood, Fashion and Music Industry millionairres and billionairres who are lavishing money on Obama (e.g., Harvey Weinstein, Anna Wintour, Spielberg, Katzenberg, rappers, Matt Damon, Julia Roberts, Letterman, Stuart, Colbert, Springstein). Obama buried old fool McCain in 2008 with nearly a billion lavished on him by plutocrats in entertainment and finance. Now, thanks to Citizens United, and the tables are turned, leftist crybabies go wa wa wa. Chickens coming home to roost. 
You're obviously referring to blacks as victims. However, the amount of violent crimes committed by contemporary White Supremicists is miniscule, while the amount of violent crimes committed by contemporary blacks is astronomical. <br/><br/>It's criminal profiling, not racial profiling, that is being done, and has undoubtedly saved many lives. But the diversity crowd only knows 'black good', 'white bad'. If blacks like you want to stop being profiled, then stop your fellow blacks from committing so many violent crimes. 
Better than slavish devotion to Hugo Chavez;  trembling with fear at attacking Iran, which openly pledges our destruction; and bowing at the feet of a worthless United Nations led by garbage dump African and Arab dictatorships.
"Democrats are far better at governance than Republicans"??? That is truely laughable. Democrats run virtually every major city in America, and the result is unions gone wild, welfare parasitism uber alles, garbage schools despite spending nearly 20ki/year/'student', flash mobs, filth, corruption at every level, etc.. Detroit. Los Angeles. Chicago. Philadelphia. Cleveland. Oh, yeah, those Dems are really good at governance. Bwahahahahahahah! 
Re  Ben...Clinton left Bush with a dot com bubble burst, a collapsed NASDAQ, the start of a recession, and Al Queda, which developed and spread worldwide under Clinton's too chicken to act gang, and which planned 9/11 under his administration while Clinton's emasculated crew fretted about privacy rights of terrorists. The job growth during Clinton's terms were due to his cutting Capital Gains taxes and the dot com revolution, only the later of which he was responsible for, and which clueless Obama is determined to reverse. 
Krugman predictably toots his one note horn. All hate all the time against Republicans, or any other person who dares disagree with his 'spend us into poverty' Keynsian hackery. Dems controlled both houses of Congress from 2006 to 2010, and the Presidency from 2008. Yet to Krugman and the NYT bobble headed readers/commenters, it's those evil Republicans and the 'rich' who are responsible for our economic problems.  To blame Republicans for the housing collapse, and smear nonpartisan career employee DeMarco the latest scapegoat is yet another fact-free Alinsky 'rules for radicals' scam by Krugman and his merry band of dogmatic leftist collectivists. 
If a group's culture plays so little role in it's members productivity and quality of life, why within the extended boundaries of every major population center in America, Europe, Asia and Africa, one can one predict with virtual certainty which population subgroups live quality lives and which are mired in violence, out of wedlock births, lack of productive effort in schools and work (even within schools, the relative accomplishments between subgroups are wildly disparate). Ridicule the role cultural values of groups and subgroups living within the same geographic and sea-access areas as accounting for differences in the quality of their lives if you wish, but no amount of terror at deeming the un PC notion that some cultures are behaviorally superior to others can wash that inconvenient truth away..
The Fed is not to blame for the depressed economy. Obama refused to move aggressively to promote private sector jobs when he was elected, despite having veto proof majorities in Congress. Instead, he spent two years on a bogus multi-thousand page 'health insurance' bill because it fit his leftist dogma. Now, Obama and his minions whine that the Fed isn't going to bail them out. Tough. You supported Obama and his anti-private-job-growth agenda, now live with the results.<br/><br/>And by the way, we learned that Obama's touted 'shovel-ready' jobs didn't exist. Kind of like the WMDs in Iraq. So if Bush lied, then Obama lied, except in Bush's case re WMD, all major Democrats thought the same. In Obama's case, any knowledgeable person would have known there were virtually no shovel ready jobs. So, Obama lied, and the economy died. At least the Fed is not jumping in to make things worse for America.
There must be a mystery mentor cell watching this planning to channel his next victim.<br/>I do not think this increase of attacks to maim many are not isolated incidents. eg Murrah, Eurora, Newton, VA Tech, Columbine, Gabrial Giffords Maybe mind control drugs or some form of vudu or brain washing system. Or maybe even channeling mind control. It seams all these people were under some form of possession or spell of hypnotism. Weak minded easily influenced individuals already fused by resentment, bitterness, hate, fear, with an aim to justify by violence. Karl Marx made a social science out of this and converted two thirds of the World population. It took a hundred years for people to realize there is no conflict in polarities . They are in perfect harmony and cooperation  Einstein ended the theory and created the opposite chain reaction by splitting the atom. My biggest question is . What was Terrorism doing all the years of the cold war. The Berlin wall fell without a fight.<br/>I always felt the American way was we are here to show you a better way . As JFK amicably said " Don't ask what the World can do for your country ask only what your country can do for the World.<br/>I only wish we had been as prepared for 911 as the show of cooperation and unity so vigilantly and miraculously displayed in Boston. The power of  good is truly greater than the power of evil.
This proves if Jesus came again he would be crucified again. Judaism ended when Jesus walked out of the river and began again.<br/>
Ignorance is bliss. no wonder there no forgiveness in Israel. War is not an answer.<br/>
We are all the chosen people now.<br/>
The Messianic age is over. Agnostic means to believe Jesus did not come to die but to live.<br/>
Agnostic means the resurrection was Spiritual and not Physical.<br/>
But I agree only God is good and we should follow Him&gt;Her in our Hearts and no man Person or Place.
Money talks and bull walks .<br/>
In a debate specifics are essential, Mojo is also important. I always feel its similar to boxing. When your hit with a hard punch, you must immediately counter punch with fury and make your opponent feel his best shots have had no effect. This is a psychological tactic even though your hurting. Romney had him at the git go and knew Obama was out to lunch with his sweety and felt guilty . The salvation of our country was in the way of the anniversary dinner and sucked all the energy out of the room. Seek ye first the elimination of romper room boy and let all other things fall into place.<br/>
But I think Obama won because he did not let himself get out of control even though I felt he wanted to drop the anchors.<br/>
Romney showed his true colors a chameleon . I hope before the next debate Obama has a steak dinner and stops the veggie diet sweety has him on . Lots of coffee not decaff real caffeine coffee. 
Good conclusion .<br/>
The GOP are also only interested in one Job Obamas.<br/>
God save us all.
Torture was to force confessions to justify war.<br/>
Marx and Engles used dialectical materialis, tricked two thirds of the World population into consensual totalitarianism.<br/>
Cheney is sliding under the fence of converting the Legislative and the Courts under the Executive being the underlying destruction of The US.<br/>
It was treasonable to betray a soldier in the White House.Valary Plame.<br/>
There was no WMD and the Iraq war was planned long before the 911 ever occurred like day one of the Bush Admin.. Ten thousand Marines are dead and one hundred thousand are wounded. The Iraqi citizens 65,000 dead and a million wounded. Three million fled and will not be home soon. .<br/>
Its ironic Tony Blair's World Book Tour was banned in Ireland.The liar claimed he only entered the Iraq war after the 911 happened . The big elephant in the kitchen was who wrote the Downing st memos and who underpinned the fake info you all dished out to Sec Gen Colin Powell.<br/>
The Americans should stop this war monger unleashing a lying legacy of slf justification of slf pitty he could not make an enviormmental disaster that would crush the World in a clean up effort for a thousand years. ..<br/>
He should be tried for putting our boys and girls in harms way unnecessarily.
These tyrannical junta Dictators have fallen so low when you see Mubarak dragged in ,in a stretcher to face killing 300 of his people in Tahrir Square and Assad is looking on as Qaddafi is hiding among the girl guides dresses in the School Convent.<br/>
42 years of oppression and terror ends a Feudal Monarchic system and gives birth in democratising the Globe..<br/>
lately I am proud of America in Wisconsin activating peaceful demonstration in toppling totalitarians using our constitutional rights.<br/>
Yes we can demonstrate the will of the people in a dubious time when our truths are not so self evident. With out sacrifice our system does not work it was not designed to have rich people inherit a legacy to hand down to mad sons.<br/>
In god we trust.<br/>
The wealth increased.<br/>
The spirit betrayed.<br/>
The house divided.<br/>
What does it profit.<br/>
On that Day His Love shall Overwhelm.<br/>
please America bring my children home.
The lady of satirical eloquence in essence has evolved into a masterful critic.<br />Happiness is still the shadow of love.<br /><br />I think when Jesus walked out of the Jordon, John should have also followed. Our only hope is to know the Messianic age is over and all mankind are the chosen people. We all need a fresh start.<br />Thanks Maureen,What a job. great stuff. Nailed it.<br /><br />
Thanks Frank for saying it like it is. I wish I could write like that. This a fantaboulous article.Great Job i hope Obama and crew read this It is simple and presents a clear picture. Look if Obama took prisoners the result would be worse than the violent reaction we have now. The point is we now have something done. This is not about the American people it's about who's in charge. Loosing Teds seat to Brown woke up the Dems to vote HCR or lose an election . We got the consolation prize with no public option. We the people get the short end when they try and repeal in the name of state rights. This is about race and who is in charge and nothing else. look at the coincidence Greenspan and irregularity is the same time frame as Reagan.
This is all about action replay. JFK got tough and blew Vietnam . Obama must not fall into the same trap. Just keep them trapped in along the third inside rail exposing the Party of NO and getting plenty of gas milage on the dead Health Care issue. Ha Ha If we never got health Care would the Economy be reformed Ha ha. Maureen, you are getting to them. They are on the run,it's clear from the defencive response. The word on the street has great talking points. 
Maybe if we consider all is polarity and male and female he made them in His own image. Adam and Eve walked and talked with God in the cool of the evening. Evil only showed up after the fall. God said don't eat the fruit or you die. We did, and no one died. Consider no evil existed before the fall. The commandment must have been a guide to inherit perfect creativity. Not a choice. Eve did not choose to fall she was beguiled tricked by a serpert a devil an Arc Angel. A Male Spititual being that made the World with God. Adam fell to Eve breaking the commandment and falling into a self centered love relationship. The history is just repeating itself all over the world for all time. My analagy is trying to portray the story. It was not the apple on the tree it was the pare on the ground. God said he accepted Abels offering and regected Cain. This time someone died. Noah got drunk and blew his position of a new begining of only eight people. Abraham blew his position and fell asleep and forgot to cut the birds. Not killing his son redeemed him but slavery prevailed for four hundred years. Joseph was betrayed by all his brothers. Jacob stole a birthright and a blessing with the help of his Mother. Ishmael was thrown out in the dirt. Moses killed an Egyptian , smashed his ten commandments, and struck the rock twice forbiding him to enter the Promised Land. Prostitutes helped Joshua and caleb to enter the The Promised land. John the Bapist asked if jesus was the one or should we look for another.Jesus answered John is the least in the Kingdom of Heaven. Jesus was murdered and condemned for sedition not one single charge held against Him not even the blind kid. I thought the purpose of Christianity was to prepare for the Second Christ. I do no think we are ready. If we prepare as a thief in the night we might be introduced to Heavenly Father and Mother God. My point is Council of Women or anybody should be in Groups. It's time for Mother Chuech to realise a new ae has begun in the midts of great confusion . There is no chosen person, people ,culture, nation , Religion, or Church. All mankind are Gods Chosen people. We are all restored little Adams and Eves returning in love in this complete resurrection Two by Two. Spiritual eternity is a reality.   
It's plain to see nobody knows what is going on. Imagine if she was the VP of our Nation overreving on a Peter principle. "Can I call you Joe". Look it's time we the People compliment ourselves on the Presidential Choice. Mc Cain is exposed as a man choosing a mad woman to handle the VP position of this Nation. Dead fish go with the flow but fiecies always floats. The resounding words of Bill Clinton in the Denver Convention are slowly kicking in. You People are on the wrong side of History. More important to me right now is shovel ready job's and the 10% unemployment rate . Please spend the stimulus package. America needs action right now.
This is just a public defence daughter and all to deter a legal criminal investigative battle, that may result in prosecution. Bill was impeached for a spot on a blue dress. To change history and preserve a legacy is this the motive for all this fan fair. This guy wants to go down in history as the Lord Protector. We know he was President. He thinks he was president George knows he was the Dogs body. Torture is usually to get people to tell what they know. These techniques were used to extract false confessions from people to say Alquaeda was connected to teaching people to manufacture WMDlinking WMD to Saddam ie; Gen Sec Powell presentation in the UN to justify WMD. The Valery Plame eposide blew the whistle. These people had to justify War. There was no WMD and the war in iraq was planned long before 911 ever happened. The 911 Comission clearly states no connection with Alqaeda and Saddam. Remember how Bush 41 said the war in Kuwait was a just war and we were a kinder gentler Nation. Who said we cut and and run, who is cutting and running now. it's only ironic to see Cheney wants the memos released to say torture worked and Obama is second guessing not to release pictures of tortured people. The justification of violence is Marxist Dialectical Materialism. The entire Engles Marx philosophy is based on the justfication of violence. I pray for the new administration to follow a pathway of peace. We must consider eight Nations have nukes. Any man in this age has to be stark raving mad to solve problems with choice one torture viloence and war. The truth is this guy was the President and he will let every body go down with blood in their hands. The thing is two wrongs does not make a right. We thought all along Cheney was transfering the power of the Judicary to the power of the Executive. I think this was the main issue not waterboarding. It's like the transfer of debt transfered from Wall St Bankers to Main St Tax Payers. Then the wrong issue becomes Corp Bonus. Wag the dog. Red became Blue hopfully for the next forty years. Carvelle might have a point to his new book. 
12 million Emmigrant's. 12 Million Unemployed. 12 million don't have health Care. Is this a new game of bait and switch. We refinanced the Banks so who picked up the tab on the toxic asset's. Mr Krugman if the Dow Jones is nearly at a staedy 9 and the price of a barrel of oil is $50 for six months straight how come the Fed Rate is not kicking in. All of a sudden has imports and exports got an effect on our GDP. We can't understand that the subprime mortgages had such an effect on our world global and transnational economy. Even five million foreclosures does not add up to this great calamity. Five million at $150,000 a shot does not even add up to the first tarp payment and now they want us to anti up again. Are we there yet. Are we there yet. Are we there yet.<br />Beware of Greek's bearing Gift's. To big to fail. Remove this phrase from our political dictionary. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS LUCK THE PREPARATORY WORK OF THE CLINTON'S AND TED KENNEDY COMBINED WITH THE OPPOTUNITY OF THE OBAMA PHENOMENON MUST BE WED. THE MARRIAGE MUST TAKE PLACE. Health said "I do" to Care. Illegal Wars cost as much. Tough Love hurt's. Now we know the nature of the beast, Katrina and Ab yu Graib were not the downfall. " To say thoes who are not with me are against me" was. This kind of leadership frightened off 187 National allie's and united our enemie's against us. To be an emigrant is torture. To be out of work is torture. To have no Health care is torture. Now we have given all the oven ready Cake's to the big wig's. Where's all the shovel ready job's. Let's get the led out. 
The first thing to do is teach everybody to regect a Party of no and don't vote for them for Forty years. Banish The GOP from representing people as a Party. I mean revoke their license. Red card no play in the next game. They have been driving drunk on the wrong side of the road for to long. They turned our bank's into Casinoe's The party of no has swown latley meaning Cheney especially to justify himself and not care for the American People. If I go down I will bring you all down with blood on everyones hand's. If you think you won an Election I will make shure you inherit a Global situation that guarantees faliure. Did That. The cards dished out to Obama were ripped from a stacked deck. If we cant have it nobody can. Reagan's wife came up with an empty slogan for people on drugs twenty years ago " Just say no to drug's". Now they laugh at us again with a new slogan for the Homeless. "Get a God Dam House.".<br />I cant take it any more when I read in The New York Times Yesderday. Israel had Nukes, war heads by the hundreds all along. I wondered why The Whole World watched the Mascure and slaughter of Gaza. No one could take them on. I hope obama has the gaul to shoot them down if they break Iran air space. We might have a Billion mad people with guns raging in the middle east. We were all led to believe Iran had one nearly. Maddof is the only guy in Jail for all this mess. Whats up. A half million a month out of work is torture. It used to be 12 million don't have health care now it's twelve million don't have job's. Does this mean we dont need health care. What happened to all the shovel ready projects. Let's get some of the led out. Obama should know the Obstructionists are creating as many distractions as possible to offset his plan . Go Obama, Go Obama. Go Obama. When opportunity meets preperation. That what a job is. There is no such thing as luck. Let's Roll. We are ready willing and able. 
So Condi was just conveying,transmitting,delivering,orders for the White House. Condi now is a conduit following orders in the wake of Colin Powell's resignation. Can she now freely convey to us why she stonewalled the 911 commisssion. One minite you have a flowing conduit and the next a backed up suer. Shame on us if we think black people don't know what torture is. This kind of torture was designed to extract a confession from people to confirm Alqueda was in iraq to justify a War planned from day one before 911 happened with no WMD. Now we have 4270 marines dead over 30,000 wounded , 650.000 Iraque civilians dead. 6 million displaced. and the middle east in a mess. This technique backfired on Pilate when he tortured Jesus, he hoped the people would feel sorry for him and guarantee his release with a pardon. Unfortunatly the mob ruled. Then he washed his hands to save his Position.  
What a fabulous article Mr Herbert. We must continue to remind ourselves to keep the ten yards down. The GOP should be forbidden to represent people for forty years on the grounds they might incriminate themselves. Churchill said in the WW2 "This is your finest hour". Obama inherited a mess and we need jobs yesderday. I for one felt during the Campaign The Party of NO were trying to make a World War Platform to facilitate The son of an Admiral fitting for a war hero. When the platform of terror did not work down went Lehman Bros, yet another ploy to stop the General Election. You must admit when you heard slogans like Bomb,Bomb,bomb Iran, Or We are all Georgians,Or I have posponed my Election Campaign. The biggest divide in America was not Sunday morning at eleven but how Bush and Mc Cain could not meet for fundraisers. My opinion is the GOP showed shame for their own Party from the Getmo. Abu Graib and Kathrina was bad but to say you never expected an attack on The Twin Towers was worse when we were hit in the same building by the same crowd in 1997. I was there. They tried to bomb the basement colums to bring the building down. I think Condi stonewalled lots of info regarding this point to cover up innaction. Three silver bullets could have changed lots of things when they surrounded Bin Laden in Afganistan. My math might be off but Five Million written off Foreclosed Homes at approx 150,000 Dollars a shot is no where near 3.2 Trillion. Or even TARP 7 bill or The Stimilus Package 8 bill. Are we just holding on to a standard of living to keep the Banks on the dole.    
macro or micro econonics, I'm lost "you had me at the fed rate is not funtioning and has no effect on the fluctuation of the elasticity of trade. The Hydron Cholider is up and running again at the end of May.They fixed the freeon Gas leak, more wiered science . We all know the effect of the chain reaction of splitting an attom. Or financing a War for no reason. I think to race atoms into each other at many times the speed of light to experiment what might happen is crazy. The big magnets are supposed to measure the carbon deposits or a new kind of diamond maybe. These guys are having a shot at finding out how God made the World or what is the answer to the theory of the big black hole. At the same time the 2012 metorite is moving past between the sun and the earth the pressure of these events could also be melting the ice and pushing us off our axis. I learned my economics from my mother she said inflation is when you spend beyond your means. I would rather this atomic experiment be carried out in outer space not fifteen miles inside our planet in Europe. Enough. 
Has the Downing St Memo anything to do with the death of Patrick Kelly. I saw an interview between Sir David Frost and Gordon Brown last week in London redredging the facts on the heels of the G20. They were planning to reinvestigate why The Brits were in the Iraq war in the first place. We must consider four investigations already took place including the famous Huntington Report to no avail. The Brits pulled their troops out this week and one hundred people died in Bagdad. Its true what this article is  saying, this baby is not going to bed. There was no WMD and the illegal War in Iraq was planned day one of the Bush Administration according to Bill Woodward's book, Wash Post editor. long before 911 ever happened. Im not looking at memos I'm looking at the shambles of the middle East,The Afgan and Pakistan debockle. Not to mention The Economic Meltdown. Lets face it it was a debt moved from Wall St to Main St Tax Payers with plenty of memos and blame to go around. Pelosi knew is the new defence so the Party of no conclude as usual two wrongs make a right. The great leadership quality of the Bush administration was to unite all our enemies against us. well you might say he did not make a world war ,or stop the general Election. Thank God for not privatizing Social Security. Cheney needs to know the two Gospels, John the Baptist was beheaded for accusing King Herod for sleeping with his brothers wife. simultaniously Jesus was forgiving Mary Magdelene for Adultry, same sin. They were of total opposite persuasions of thought. To me this symbolizes the two doctrines eye for eye and tooth for tooth is replaced by Obama's doctrine a win ,win solution of forgivness and love if you repent. But then again Jesus was crusified so in the end its up to the people of the peope by the people for the people. This time lets not do things right but lets "do the right thing". Imagine if Puncious Pilate had not washed his hands that day and took resposibility, we should not wash our hands of this and let history continue to repeat itself. This Pig is wearing purple eye shadow with FLU like symtoms with epidemic pandemic consequences. This is not an isolated incident it pertains to our Constitution. You cannot move forward with a leaky radiator hose in just a few miles you will have no engine. 
I thought Amendments could be amended by a Refurendum.<br />It's not like legal memos that look like they approve torture to cover your touch in the event of protest,<br />Your article is like the expose of the torture memos but where is the political will of the people. Our moral conscience does not have the steel girders to hold up and underpin the architectural social design. We have gone global with people whom are undisiplined with no regulation or moral conscience. The rules cant even rule Pirates. As long as morality is not entertained into the equasion of Democracy it wont work, This is why we need guns. Evil and God were not part of Karl marx system of Dialectical Materialism, his Social Science left out two major components.It fell because it did not make sense. 76 million people died in WWII, This tells me there is evil, Without the sacrificial endevour of sacrifical people Democracy will not work, Greed and imorality is devouring our great experiment. Obama might say we are not a Christian nation but without the moral development of the charactar of our hearts and spirits, This article will be written next year statistically in greater numbers to no avail. We failed Jesus he did not fail us we left God He never left us. Matt 5,48 You therefore can be perfect as your heavenly Father in Heaven is perfect. Let us strive to build a more Perfect Union.  
Why pick on the Irish. We only have three million citizens an one million Latvians and Polish working for nothing. A slave society with a false sense of economic confidence. You have 250 million people kicking out the Mexicans and you have the moxy to compare yourself to the Irish. I know what you are saying is your self justification our selfishness matches our greed. The great combination that led us down into the pit. Eve was in the Garden looking for a more mature love relationship and found a feel sorry for yourself selfish jelous Satan in the bushes. Adam had not yet discovered his stimulus package. We never even got our fourth of july yet from the British. While you revive your Tea Parties in disruption for the Party of NO. Reveal your sins of Torture but not what the banks did with the TARP MONEY. Double standard. I ALWAYS THOUGHT CONTINGENCY PLAN WAS AN ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT PLAN REFERING TO PLAN B. THE NEW NAME FOR THE WAR ON TERROR. And by the way "La go bragh" means "It's a beautiful day". Did you know Tached cottages are the in thing now and we dont have pigs in the kitchen. Think of it we survived worse than this we used to have eighteen million people before the potato Famine. Now 20% of the population of the US is Irish. That's like one fifth, yes forthy million. Dont fool yourself into thinking Obama got there by the Black vote. Hey Krughman go pick on someone your own size. Fell sorry for yourself someplace else.   
This article is just to get us off Tea bags and Torture.<br />one thing is for shure if this Administration is to move to the next meal. Let's clean off the table. This Emporor never had any clothes. 
Hey Bono .<br /> "It's a beautiful day".<br /> We must compliment The Bush regime that led us down into the pit for three things. 1 He did not start a World War. 2 He did not privatize Social Security. 3 He did not stop the General Election. I don't like Bush but I'm against the blame game. Christianity had a mission to prepare for Christ and no one was ready introducing Communism and three world wars. Now The Southern Bapist Christian right, Our Congress and Senate including the British Parlement and many nations voted for the War in Iraq. The blame game does not work. We must look at ourselves and participate in the process. My mantra is there was no weapons of mass destruction and the war in Iraq was planned from day one of the Bush administration long before 911 ever took place. I hope the world ignoring the Gaza mascure does not give the moxy to Natanyahu to bomb, bomb, bomb, Iran. Otherwise we could have an echological disaster that would take one thousand years to clean up.<br /><br />Thanks Bono, and your great group U2. You do the Irish proud we truly love you for all that you do. I read your Da was the guy who believed in you guy's and gave you the few quid to cut the first album. I would not argue with him we all owe him. He made you guys and believed in you all. Some day you will talk to me I'm a Dubliner thats been around and God has given me a message for you He told me He loves you and a time will come and you will know it's me it shall be revealed to you thoes three special words . "He is here".<br /><br />Kieran O'Neill. "Yea The O'Neill Clan". 
O Yea. Where is Universal Health care promised by<br />CLINTON,OBAMA,AND KENNEDY. Dashel is gone now whats up. The big 20 dump a trillion on the world sceen. 12 million have no Health Care in the US. The Clintons promised with no delivery in their tenure. Whats up. Wagnor got a 20 million golden parachute. Yea we were angry about the last eight years. The Pentagon did not reduce costs and eliminate expenses to justify a war. The biggest problem to balance the budget is being shoved in our faces as the reduction of Health Care expences. Nobody said anything in balancing a budget for the unjust war. We want Universal Health Care yea 12 million People. Dont start explaining us away all thoes in Europe have it. Smiles and phychology did not get this administration where they want to be. They promised health Care. Now it's being explained away. We haven't seen a first down. All we see is nuclear warheads flying over japan. Not to mention Iran shooting up a sputnic latley. After 911 why even take a chance. These guys could scramble our communications. 
Two commedians made a name for themselves and pumped up their ratings calling us out without laughing. This is the cost of doing business. Whats the big polemic. This is not a Katrina moment. This is a malox moment after eight years of Bush and failed policies. You cannot expect Obama to be called out on every toilet roll missing from the bathroom. I doubt he will say I screwed up on this one. If it's not Rent on a limo a lapsed tax payment or 2% Porky the Pig it is seen to be perfect obstructionism that ties up the boat at the dock as we rev full steam ahead making lots of white splashing water going nowhere. Ironically some of the Republicans are for paying the bonuses now.  The Republicans are so elated to have a new whipping boy Geithner to defame the ratings of a popular President. Look they got one in the basket. Even in basket ball people win on technical fouls. Whats the big polemic on miniscuel bonuses that can be retracted when the real problem is eighteen years of no regulation creates an AIG monster in forty seven foreign foreign countries with a budget four times bigger than Home Land Security. look don't sweat the small petti stuff it's just the cost of doing business in the age of corruption. What shall become of us if God forbid Michelle surges with a splurge to buy new dishes for the White House. The more things change the more they stay the same. One thing I would suggest is everybody is on Geitner and rightly so expressing how techy and smart he is but he lack's the art of salesmanship. Have you ever seen what happens to your sales when you let the mechanic talk to the customers. We need to sell the sizzle not the grizzle. I will be sad for America if the hard working successful people are punished for being successful.     
Hey Blow, a plough horse and a race horse both eat grass. The thing is the race horse makes more money. I can't shoot hoops like Mike Jordon or score goals like Becham. The American dream is we are not punished for being successful. if these guys got busted they must have been a bubble. The thing is this is OUR money and these are the very guys that sank the Titanic lieing cheating and stealing sticking it to us taking the most for the least. These guys did not earn this money we did and we lent it to them in hope. To big to fail is a treat we fell for. This culture of no regulation in the last eighteen years got so big and arrogant it bloated out Companies like AIG to be four times the size of The budget of Home land Security and fanged out it's tazor edge teeth and claws into forty six Countries around the globe. We must humble to the arrogance and quickly blame ourselves and pamper it's pride and feed them with big bonuses or else we are told the world would stop. I don't mind bailing out the boat but this is our boat. Obama gets it it's Global. Thanks for your candor allowing us to vent our anger but I don't think the word in your first paragraph should be "Gambled" it should be "SABOTAGE". I STILL THINK LEHMAN BROS WAS THE HOSTAGE THROWN OFF THE PLANE TO ENSURE SERIOUS DISCUSSION FOR TARP, SO AS THEY COULD FLY AWAY WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE'S TAX DOLLARS. When you mess with the system it bites you. Just like the smartallic school children moved the clock forward an hour to get out of school early. The next morning the were all late for school. The system is so broken that when they cry wolf we kill the shepard. Obama is not worried about rocking the boat but lets get this boat off the rocks. How can we go fullsteam ahead when the party of NO consistently tie up the boat at the dock. Last week Dashel went down for not payin rent on a limo now we have no health care Zaar. The week before we dealth with 2% Porkey the Pig. This is not a time to tax Taxes on money we invested to create credit. What will it be O God forbid if Michele splurges and buys new dishes for the white House. Yes we Can.    
Christopher Hitchens says that Religion Poisons Everything. Is he right? Well the recent killing of coptic Christians in Egypt prove that hate among so-called religious still there and we don't really know where this problem is supposed to end. The arab spring really brought democracy or it is just another Muslim crusade to eliminate the non-muslims? The Egyptian people managed themselves to kick Mubarak out by expecting to have a true democracy. Guess what? They dug their own funeral hole. There is no democracy in this world. "democracy is the worst form of government except all the others that have been tried." (Winston Churchill). Why? Because the Devil can influence people's votes and plunge them into killing themselves.
This is the primary reason that I stopped watching NBC and MSNBC!  They consistently make incendiary comments,  and many times they are not supported by even the flimsiest of facts.   I guess to some MSNBC is an alternative to FOX,  but it seems to most viewers that FOX is a paragon of virtue when compared to MSNBC.   It appears MSNBC with their screaming,  attacking,  and demeaning is more like RUSH,  and I can only take so much of him.   We need to pull together as a nation and with this kind of stuff continually on the airwaves it is going to be hard.
I was a Republican for 30 years and changed to Independent a couple of years ago because of Bush's endless wars.  I have always believed the Republican party cared about the middle class.  I was wrong!   The Ryan budget proves one thing.   They one care about corporations,  the rich,  and the elite in this country.   On morning Joe today I heard the comment that no amount of means testing could solve the Medicare issues.   This is a flat lie.   The upper middle class and the rich love their free health care and they want to keep it.   They do not want to pay more nor do they want their taxes increased to protect the poor or help the middle class never mind it was the middle class for the last 70 years that has indirectly paid more than their fair share.   The money that was to go into to medicare and social security was going into the general fund.  For the most part it was the people who made under $100,000 that was paying the lions share for Social Security.  So I think it is reasonable to argue the middle class has paid more than they were suppose to pay in taxes the last 60-70 years.   Medicare and Social Security can solve their problems easily through means testing.   Here is the formula:    First,   Means test Social Security.    Second,   All income over $108,000 is subject to an additional 4% Social Security tax.  This would be in addition to the means testing.  Third,  Medicare would be means tested.    Fourth,   those with incomes and savings that provide them more than $250,000 per year would pay full premium for medicare and their deductible would be $15,000 for part A and $7,500 for Part B.   Those with incomes in retirement of $100,000 to $250,000 would have a $10,000 ded for part A and a $5,000 for part B.   Those with incomes of $50,000 to $100,000 in retirement would have a $5,000 Part A and a $2,500 for part B.   Those with incomes of less than $50,000 in retirement would pay based on a graduating scale,  but only the poorest would enjoy the current situation of only $150 ded for part B.   I don't want to hear any garbage about Medicare and Social Security not working.  The problem is the upper middle class,  the rich,  and the elite want their taxes low and they want all their government goodies as well.   Currently,  all these talking heads on TV make millions of dollars and none of them want to pay additonal Social Security taxes or have their benefits means tested nor do their want to pay the full premium for Medicare and have a high ded for part A and B,  but that is exactly what needs to happen.   This is exactly the way it should have been set up to begin with.    It was a crime for Roosevelt to allow the rich to draw Social Security but not to pay for it on their entire earnings.   This talk of raising the age of retirement is a NON-STARTER..........Yes people are living longer,  but they are not necessarily healthier.   All we would do if we increase the age is force more people to file disability.   It is time we woke up and changed these policies to suit the situation.   Medicare part A and B for the rich should essentially be a major medical plan.    Medicare part A and B for those making 50-100 should have a sizable ded. and only for the retired poor should medicare be as it is currently today.   Any talk of a voucher system designed to keep future costs down to protect the rich, elite and those in the upper tax brackets is a non-starter.   Americans are waking up to the fact that most of our countries problems started with the tax reductions of 1980.   The great Presidency of Ronald Reagan has bankrupted this country!    We need to put our house in order,   but we are not going to do it by continuing Social Security checks for the rich.   Nor by allowing the rich to protect their full income from Social Security or the rich reaping the benefits of Medicare and not paying the full premium.   THE TIME HAS ARRIVED AND THE WEALTHY HAS TO START PAYING FOR THEIR PERKS!!!!!!!!!!!!  
What I am going to say is going to sound harsh,  but I believe it is the only hope we have to deal with this third world terrorism.   We survived and thrived during the cold war because of a simple concept of mutually assured destruction.   Both sides understood that if either side launched their nuclear armaments it would mean both countries and probably the world would be destroyed.   Currently,   we have dozens of small countries that are allowing terrorist inside their borders because they believe and support the very things those terrorists are fighting for.   At the same time these countries are giving us lip service,  excepting our money,  minimal help and support.   They aren't really in an all out war to root out these terrorists.   It simply is not in their interest to do so.  Imagine this scenario.   There are 1,000 Americans traveling the globe butchering arabs,  blowing up middle easter property and generally committing carnage and mayhem.   Do  you think such a thing could happen anywhere in the world?   No it could not because no one in the world is going to financially support,  sympathize with,  or shelter any American engaged in terrorism.   These terrorists have dozens of countries and millions of people who will either help them or turn a blind eye to their behavior.   Even in European countries they are allow to stand on the street corner and preach their hate without impunity.   So what is the answer.    Anything less than a strategy similar to the cold war strategy will not work.   We have to treat countries and communities that harbor and help these people as our enemies and take them down.   We have to announce to the world that if a nuclear, biological,  or chemical weapon is detonated in our country we will find out the nationality of the people ultimately behind the disaster and that country will pay.   That means countries like Saudi Arabia will have to stop allowing their schools,  and religious institutions to preach and teach hate.   Countries like Iran,  Pakistan,  Syria etc. will be told the first time we are attacked if their people are involved they will be attacked.  No more giving them money which they turn around and give to the terrorists.   TIME TO GET TUFF!   Better we do it now before the disaster occurs.   The American people will not stand for it when it comes so you have better start making the necessary changes NOW!  
The Democrats mishandled Health Reform!    They determined to impose a nationwide system of health care regardless of how angry it made the American people.   They did this without Republican support and only about 35% of the American people in agreement.   The first time in 60 years that a program, of this significance, was foisted on the country without the other party being involved and without the support of the people.  Democrats came to the conclusion they had a veto proof Senate and regardless of the horrible economy were going to push the bill through.   They succeeded in imposing their will,  but now comes the payback for this ill conceived plan.  I do not believe,  in the final analysis,  the American courts are prepared to pass on this bill, considering the above facts.   It is going to come down to one Supreme Court Judge!   I just can't see the court allowing a small minority to determine 1/6 of the economy, when it involves such a contentious issue.   The best thing the Democrats could do is sit down at the table with Republicans and rework the entire thing before this reaches the Supremes.   I don't think the Democrats want to have the 2012 election shortly after a negative ruling of Health Care. 
Two weeks ago on another site I predicted Keith Olbermann would get fired in 2011!  I am alittle surprised it happened so quickly.   However, this guy was revolving around some galaxy many light years from this one.   This simple fact is this guy was killing NBC and for that matter all of network news.   Multiplied millions have stopped watching all programming on the big three because ABC, NBC, CBS have become megaphones for the left.   This guy and all the network new divisions are dragging down their networks regular programming.   People are infuriated with the slanted and steady diet of distorted news they are getting to the point FOX has become the only source of news for half the country.   It is way past time for the major news outlets to clean house.   The news divisions should for the most part reflect the market.   People are paying good money for CNN, and MSNBC,  Fox,  and they have a right to expect some semblance of fairness.   ABC has illustrated how far off the deep end they have fallen with their acquisition for their Sunday morning line up.   They had a powerful middle-of-the road newsman in Jake Tapper and they chose to go outside and get another reporter off the deep end.   People are just totally fed up with this foolishness and are canceling newspaper subscriptions,  and turning off CNN and the big three.   I predict CHANGES ARE COMING!   
I have never read an article more foolish or one I disagree with more than this silly article.  To suggest the country went to the polls, not even ten days ago, and in one of the most historic elections, threw out 64 Democrats from the house and then to suggest the people didn't really want to do this is, at the least, hair brained!  This kind of thinking is going to hurt the Democrats in the next election.   It seems to go along with the other nonsense we hear coming from Democrats like;  the electorate is stupid,  uneducated,  care only about their guns and bibles,  didn't understand what we were doing.   The American people know exactly what is going on in this country and they didn't approve of most of it.   If the Democrats continue to lie to themselves they are going to face an even worse disaster in the next election.   The American people hate pelosi and reed,  they want smaller government,  they want a balanced budget,  taxes kept to a minimum,  congress to work together and compromise on solving the social security and medicare issues.  Most of all they want congress to revisit health care and craft a truly bi-partisan bill.   If two years pass and non of these things get worked on there will be more Democrats and maybe Republicans shown the exit. 
Nancy Pelosi may have done a great job!   And she may be remembered as a powerful and successful Speaker!  However,   she seems to be in a state of total delusion.   This is the only the second time in my life that the Democrats have allowed themselves to become totally deluded.   Jimmy Carter was in a state of delusion and from his recent comments he still is.  Now we have Barach Obama who seems to be a carbon copy of Carter.  He is operating in a state of delusion.   He constantly attacks his own Democrats and Republicans when the American people want him to LEAD!!!   That means stop attacking and take responsiblity and work to make things better.   Are you capable of making things better?  I am beginning to wonder.
Too little to late!    He always has to increase taxes or take away tax breaks from someone in order to fund one of his pet projects.   He Never Cuts Anything!   That is why we are in desperate shape in this country.
It needs fixed Now!
I am conservative and not opposed to playing politics  but in this case we need to fix the problem and not the blame.   After the problem is fixed and cleaned up we can point fingers.   Personally,   I would like the President to give this the kind of seriousness he would give a Chernobyl like accident!!!!!  I wish he would call a meeting Tuesday morning at the White house and bring the brightest minds from the four corners of the globe to bear on this issue.   Tell the Navy beginning today the spill is their problem!!  Working with BP they are to stop the leak ASAP and clean the mess up and this is a NUMBER ONE NATIONAL AGENDA!    NOTHING LESS WILL DO.    We can't sit  back for the next 3-4 four months and watch BP play the American people like they are doing.    This disaster has to be handled and it has to be handled NOW nomatter what the cost!
People are sick of the one sided news reporting and you get a load of it on CNN!   They just don't want to change.   Most of the networks losing money won't move away from the liberal model even tho people are sick of it and even tho it is costing them money.   So they can send their message out into the ethos with no one watching.
I use to watch CNN much more than I do now.   I rarely watch any news programs and when I do I watch FOX.  I am weary with the one sided reporting and I think the majority of Americans feel the same way.   I really do not like one sided reporting.   I am sickened by what I see on MSNBC.   CNN needs to be totally down the middle and it needs to be much more combative.   Democracy is a combat sport!   Democracy is a war with bloodshed.   CNN seems to think they can pretend to be middle of the road but they are anything but middle of the road.   Middle of the road means you have guests arguing all sides of an issue and the monitors aren't all liberal in their politics.   CNN needs to get with the program.   If they continue the way they are they will cease to be a force in American news. 
For the first time in a long, long time I actually felt good about the two rulings that came out today by the Supreme Court.   I actually thought they finally "got it".    It isn't about some dead document or some political agenda it is about "us".     What is best for "our" country.    Finally,   somebody has started doing something that was good for our country.     
The last thing this country needs is another lying Senator!   Please with the problems our country faces we do not need lied to we need politicians who have the guts to speak the truth.   This fellow has a basic character flaw and that is another thing we don't need another Senator with major character flaws.   When are we going to wake up in this country!
As a conservative republican I would like to see a moderate appointed to the supreme court.   I am not naive enough to think that is going to happen.   Considering the choices Obama put forward to pick from I think this Kagan woman is as good as any.   I think it is a mistake to make a big fight over this pick.   We need to stay focused on the election.   Attacking this woman would only seem narrow and unwarranted by the American people.   Right now Republicans are in a position to gain seats in the fall an attack on Elena Kagan could not help our position in the fall.   In fact,   I think it is not in the best interests of either party to fight over the supreme court pick this summer.   People are in a angry state of mind and there is no way to know exactly how the American people would react to attacks regarding a Supreme court pick.   My advice let her go onto the court without any fanfare.   
If your logic is correct would you apply it to John F. Kennedy or how about Robert Kennedy.   How about applying your distorted logic to Martin Luther King Jr.   Maybe you have heard the axiom that goes,  "that which proves to much proves nothing."   Such is the case with your proofs regarding moral behavior and particular members of society.   People act out for a lot of reasons and many of those reasons have little to do with morals.   Sometimes they are a reflection of the tremendous amounts of stress certain people put themselves under.   Then again some of us just compartmentalize our lives.   Whatever I am growing very tired of the media types drawing to much from a 32 year old billionaire acting out in mid-life.    He is not a politician!    Please get out of his life and just leave him alone and give the rest of us a little rest. 
This is not the USSR despite what the Democrats think!   Come November we intend to show them what we think.   They are going to pay and pay dearly for betraying the American people 
As a lifetime Republican I am going to be very very disappointed if my fellow Republicans don't get totally behind these reforms.   This is the kind of bill I think has been needed for a very long time.   Republicans should oppose the President when he is wrong  but when he is right they should get on board.   In the case of this education bill he is absolutely right.   REPUBLICANS SHOULD FAST TRACK THIS BILL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
I am an Independent.   I voted for Barach Obama!    However,   I do not approve of highhanded tactics to overrule the American people.   I think if the Democrats do this it will be a catastrophe for Democrats on par with what watergate was for Republicans.
This is the first article I have read about Health care that I have agreed with.   I think first if they want this thing to pass they will have to change the name and call it something other than Health Care legislation.  In addition,   your ideas to keep costs down are super but I don't think the Democrats will ever buy into it.  You know if the Democrats hadn't gone into this thing with the attitude of take it or leave it and we are goin get all we can get and included Republicans from the beginning and especially if Obama had had the guts to take on the Lawyers from the beginning we would have a bill right now.   Here we are a year later and his presidency is on the line and he still won't take on the lawyers.   It is too bad but bi-partisanship always seems to be directed at the Republicans by the media,   but I see little or none of it from Democrats.   Our whole country is in sad shape because we need to get away from political parties and start getting pragmatic before it is too late.  However,  having said that I am furious that the Democrats have wasted two years messing with this at a time when we need some many other things done.
Like most Americans I am just worn out with this foolishness!   I don't understand how we have a president who goes on national television asking for bipartisanship the very day he releases a bill that epitomizes that very thing.     He knows how sick the country is of this issue!   He knows we are practically bankrupt!   He knows that the majority of Americans are against this bill!   And yet he persists!   I just don't understand when he only has six months to get legislation passed before the election to try and get his party out of the deep hole they have dug for themselves and he goes back and starts again on what appears a losing issue.   I do sympathize with the President he came so close,   but you just can't do things of this magnitude without the support of the American people.   I don't see these skittish congressman passing something like this.   I can't imagine how damaging it will be to the Democrats if they were to spend the next 6 months arguing over this bill.   I am 60 years old and this is the first time I have ever seen a political party risk so much so close to an election.,
The Democrats really have no one to blame for this but themselves.   Bayh has been pretty well and he had a better than average chance of winning.   The moderates in the Senate are sick and tired of this extreme liberalism and the chronic bickering it is causing in our country.   The simple fact is the people do not support Obama and the liberal Democrats and their agenda.   It appears against the will of the people they are going to try and use reconciliation to ram it down our throat which result in nothing short of an all out war.    Democrats are going to continue losing some of their best if they persist in this hopeless and hapless path they have chosen.
I am reluctant to give Haiti any money until they turn those baptists loose!    We are spending billions helping them and they lock up 10 people trying to help them.   I don't believe for a minute those 10 people were trying to market those children.

Obama is not up for election so why should he compromise!   After all he is not the one who is going to have to go home at the end of this year.   His career will not end at the end of 2010.   You can bet the speech he gave tuesday night would have been substantially different if he was up for reelection.   That is why he is a total hippocrite!   Frankly,   he intends to push his bogus socialist agenda as long as he can.   So we can expect, one degree or another,  the same issues that have infuriated the American people will be shoved down our throats between now and the fall.   Of course,   you can be certain the speech he gives next January will be quite contrite.   It won't do him any good.   The American people see him for what he is;  a arrogant,  self-involved,  promoter who doesn't understand the people of this country or really care about them.   Expect his party to fall and afterward the demise of the great one.    
I must say how surprised  I am by the negativity toward Ms Gilbert and Eat Pray Love. She's a writer who went on a very interesting journey paid for by a publisher and then wrote about it,  How pathetic the nasty envy for a balanced, happy extremely generous, honest human being. Such petty thinking.  Isn't a wealthy, independent woman allowed to have her story and write about it. Lighten up people. And those who never read it, do not judge the book by the movie. 
Elizabeth Gilbert is a joy to read, listen to and think about. Her understanding and openess about  the mystery of life give such comfort. . As John Keats wrote, "a thing of beauty is a joy forever," and Elizabeth has created that in herself and her work.  Humans will be reading her encouragement of existence always. I thank her very much for sharing herself so. Her words and being help me.
Consciousness exists in many dimensions.  
The Mayor needs to slip into a Twilight Zone episode where he is poor and a minority and is constantly stopped and frisked wherever he goes. Then he may have empathy for the horror of this policy. 
Stop and frisk is  a very dangerous risk to basic American laws of this land. Dangerous neighborhoods need more surveillance, but the stop and frisk policy goes against America's civil law principle, and we must guard against abuse of any kind by not allowing it. In airports they announce what we are subject to, so we know what to expect, but in front of people's residences, walking in the neighboorhood, no. We must protect our rights no matter what the nighborhood. The police just must walk the beat and hope they see a crime in progress, or very, very suspicious activity. Stopping and talking, yes, stopping and frisking an invasion of privacy.
Marvelous column, Maureen.  Recently I watched the movie, The Shoes of the Fisherman from 1968, and remembered how when the Russian Pope puts  up all the Church's wealth to save the Chinese people from starvation and avoid a world war. If only the Catholic chruch truly lived by the true teaching of Jesus, to love thy neighbor as thyself, to live simply.  The Catholic Church will have to change as the world is changing, communicating, discovering the truth of one humanity all trying to survive on this planet.
Yes, leaps of faith can take us to the most rewarding places. Luckily for Don Quixote, he just found himself in the meadows. Too many have to actaully fight the serpents and lizards in the the black bog in order to get through to the beauty. Like sane people have to fight through the Republican leadership of the house.
Thank you for writing about Mr. Meyers.  The love surrounding him, his love of life and his acceptance of losing such precious mementos with grace. I agree with him so on one needs a bed, clean underwear and a shower to be able to face life everyday with enthusiasm. I especially love the three glasses of wine a day.
Dear Dick,<br/><br/>Among all the horror and sadness in the world today, your essay is truly a pleasure to read. I'm so glad you made it aboard and shared with us your harrowing experience. You are a treasure Mr. Cavett. You did deserve an audience for your leap, and the ship should never have left without you
I still am baffled by the number of votes Romney won. How could ignorance be so close in a race against truth and  intelligent scientific facts of life? We, the winners of further enlightenment, must continue to fight for truth. We must help those who are born into ignorance have access to education to learn facts that support humans continuing on this exquisite planet.  In scientific earth time, humans have only been here for two seconds on a trwenty-four hour clock. I sure hope we make it to at least five seconds before we wipe ourselves out. There is hope.
Thank you for writing about this. I spoke of Rubio's statement at Thanksgiving dinner. We must never let up on ignorance trying to be truth. Science is what is by repeated experiment and study. Religion are stories by men that may be inspired by God, but they're not truth, just faith. Scientific proof must always be taught in schools.
Ego, ego, ego and boredom, boredom, boredom, even for Generals, and heads of  the CIA, and some past presidents.  Yes, sex and envy make people stupid, but.... the aforementioned is really what it is about. 
The House Republicans will be watched very carefully. Balking at helping fix the problems of the country rationally, will send them further and further into the fanatical fringe. Then, hopefully, the country will give the Democrats the ability to fix with logic and sacrifice of all understood, win both houses and make the country strong and fiscally responsible once again.. 
Good writing, but the ridiculous description of the President is really pathetic.  He's energized by the truth and that many, such as, Powell, Christie and Bloomberg realize the future of America in reality is no phantom theory anymore. We have no control over the weather and we better take the climate seriously, as well as human and women's rights. We need a brilliant, rational, compassionate President, and they acknowledged it finally.  I believe the President is going to win, and it will be so wonderful to have Romney disappear back into his hypocritical, stand for nothing, life.
Those are commendable pro-life causes that Mayor Bloomberg has instigated, but what about stop and frisk, and allowing male police officers to frisk females. An innocent woman being frisked against her will by men because she is a minority is a form of molestation so horrific,.. well, it is right up there with the thinking of Akin, Mourdock, and Walsh. Mayor Bloomberg is not giving those women a right to choose.
Sorry, Maureen, but I think you have done your sister Peggy a real disservice by telling us how backward and, yes, stupid she is to think about voting for a known liar like Romney that stands for nothing, and a vice presidential candidate that thinks a just fertalized egg is a human being.  It would be hard for me to have any respect for a sister like that. 
Your column is the most perfect explanation of the Romney/Ryan platform. Extreme lies to go along with their extreme idiology. Two very scary men who will say anything to gain power. It terrorizes me that  there are so many who believe them. Thank you.
Oh, Maureen, how can you bear the thought of a Romney/Ryan win?  They want to control women's bodies like the Taliban. The thought that there are so many people willing to give up the freedoms that women and minorities around the world have fought for by voting for these two close minded men scares me more than Bush Cheney and look at the hell they' put us through. President Obama is a brilliant, honest, decent, caring man who has devoted his life to public service and the other two are self serving white men that don't deserve the office they seek. I will be heartsick and despondent if R&amp;R win, and I'll volunteer the next day at Planned Parenthood.  Maybe I'll do that anyway, because President Obama must win.
I was very disappointed in President Obama's lack of attack at all of Mitt Romney's lies. However, Mitt Romney lied throughout, just his delivery was good. I'm hoping that conservatives will be so shocked at last night's performance by fake Democrat Mitt Romney, they won't vote for him now
Fat bullying has been going on and on and on. However, as much as I realize that there is an obesity epidemic, the constant discussion of the negativity of being overweight will give people an excuse to bully. I don't believe anyone chooses to be fat. Study after study show that overweight bodies crave food the way an alcoholic's body craves liquor. Yes, some people are much stronger than others and can fight the urge to eat successfully. Food addiction is the most prevalent addiction that shows on the human body. We must be very careful how we stigmatize overweight children, or life will become even more unbearable from the cruelty. 
I think, Maureen, you hope Romney does win, so you'll have more to write about that makes sense when you castigate a President. President Obama's speech did not in any way blame the people. He was saying that the problems were so enormous, and the Republicans so bent on his destruction that it is taking longer to solve them, and he needs four more years to make sure we stay on the right course to make this happen. Romney and Ryan will set the country back to the fifties in ignorance and lack of tolerance.  I understand your need for controversy, but I don't believe you believe what you're writing. 
No, President Obama is protecting a woman's right  to protect and govern her own body.  I'm positive the President wants it to be safe, legal and RARE, just like anyone else with common sense. But, it must remain the woman's decision.
I'm so glad, Maureen, that you are stating the scary truth about Romney and Ryan. Comparing Mitt to President Obama is truly as bizarre to me as the question, 'Did you bring your lunch or did you walk to work.' No sense at all. President Obama is running for America, not just his base. He wants to protect us from the right wing terrorizing zealots of the Republican party, and I do think that men who want to control women's bodies the way Ryan really does is on the road to Taliban thinking.  And Romney choosing such a man is on the same level as McCain picking Palin, pathetic. Anything to win, but a good excuse if they lose.<br/><br/>The President has kept America going.... no we are not out of the woods, but he said over and over when he was running in 2008 that it was a long road ahead for recovery and he has kept us on the right track.  <br/><br/>.
Venus and Serena are very nearly perfect in their tennis, manners, truth and fineness.  Their parents raised two normal yet brilliant women.  I agree they should never go back to Indian Wells. Thank you, Venus and Serena for giving us so much pleasure and excitement.  
Romney, Ryan, Cheney, W represent the white male and many a white female that are terrorized of losing control in this country. They are not willing to accept the changes of a country and world, and especially the climate.  It staggers me that after all the history of this planet, the obvious truths of science and evolution we allow ignorance to rule so many humans just born into it... and through constant communication, the ability for ignorance to be accepted in the media as truth.  Two men are running for office that have no empathy for the struggle of life for so many. They only want the status quo of the few having it all, the wealth and the power. I have to believe that intelligence, belief in the truth as proven by repeated situations through time will get us through the ignorance and selfishness of the now republican party.  A true and rational essay, Maureen. 
Sounds like it's time to put this weiner between 2 buns and call it a day.
Destruction and chaos is a wonderful way to remember Trayvon Martin.  These people are so ridiculous that they would ruin the memory of a young man killed.   You are not honoring his memory by hurting others.  I blame all this on the media.  They started all of this months and months ago, it didn't have to go this far.  Stupid.
I'll bet his wife is so emotionally beat down by this egomanic that she can't leave him.  
I think we have already seen enough of this clown.  Are you kidding me?  
That is ridiculous.
The cops that work in schools are not retired.  They are active duty officers assigned to schools.  
I think that is what we have to do.  This and banning assault rifles should work, but if there is really a crazy person intent of doing something horrific...he will.  
I have experienced severe childhood truama.  In my thirties I decided to go see a therapist for my depression, "morbid depression" I was labeled.   We went through the trauma and I came out fine.  I am now in 53 been happy for years, and think people do not work hard enough to get themselves "right".  We rely on medicating people instead of helping them do the work.  I am no therapist but do know what can work.  How can someone be on antidepressant medication for years and years?  I'm not talking about bipolar or psychotic disorder.
It seems to me that more and more people everyday are suffering from "Narcissistic personality disorder ".  I don't remember so many people thinking they were so self important.  Just look at our Sports figures and Government Officicals.  People used to be humble.  What the heck happened?  Does society make people "catch" narcissistic personality disorder?  Have parents done something to their children?  We all know people who have this disorder.  We usually call them jerks, but are they sick?
Well it's about time.  Thanks for dragging your feet Mr. Bernanke.  Interesting this happens just prior to the presidential election...
Hmm, sounds like Mr. Obama thinks he thought this up all on his own.  Didn't this plan get implemented under the Bush administration?  What exactly has Mr. Obama done for any of us?  How many of us have either been or are unemployed with the promise creating more jobs?  How many of us have lost our homes because Mr. Obama thought it more important to partner with China regarding STREETLIGHTS of all things, then to come up with a plan to really help Americans who have worked hard save their homes from foreclosure?  Get this do nothing President out of office!

Get Obama out of office and you will see the unemployment rate dramatically drop.  Businesses are afraid to hire with Obama in office. I know I am.  He claims to have saved the auto industry...then wouldn't there be a ripple effect to the economy?  The unemployment has not been under 8 percent in 41 months, how long does it take Obama to turn things around?
Blame it on Obama.  His stupid "bail out" didn't help anyone.  I suspect the Banks think they dupped him and are hopeful he'll do it again before his term is up.  I think it's time we stop leaving everything up to Government and get more involved.  This is ridiculous and I for one am sick of it.
Obama probably didn't even know what was going on...he strikes me as that type of President.  He can't answer the questions because he is oblivious to what went on.  Obama needs to pay attention.  The Border Patrol officers shouldn't have to sacrifice their lives because of our President is too busy going to Sarah Parker's house instead of knowing what is going on under his Presidency.  Get him out of the White House!
You, my friend, have just figured out how Jeffrey Picower made his billions. 
The key to getting the coating to adhere is to simply dredge the seasoned cutlets in a little flour, then dip in egg and finish tossing them in either bread crumbs, panko or for a really nice, crisp crust matzoh meal. Also remember to use about a half inch of oil and shallow fry in a hot cast iron Lodge skillet.<br/>Olive oil is fine for Milanese but a bit pricey and unnecessary for most cutlets. I do schnitzel in Canola or peanut oil, both of which can withstand the heat and results are perfect. 
The DOJ needs now to focus its attention on Frank Avellino and Michael Bienes. These are the two accountants who were in on the Ponzi from its inception and were the original feeders who grew fabulously wealthy off their skim. They were shut down by the SEC who foolishly called off an investigation back in '93 which allowed a fraud with 400Million in assets to balloon to well over 17 Billion. These two miscreants continued to profit from the scheme for years afterward however by demanding "schtupp money" ( see trustee's report) from Madoff as tribute. The trustee is suing them for 900 Million but they are clearly insiders on this fraud who are directly responsible for ruining thousands of lives. They should be fully disgorged and criminally prosecuted.

Psilakis restos are great, when Psilakis is there. Sadly, that is about as common as an Elvis sighting.
Admissions at an uber competitive university such as Cal should be simplified and broken down into 2 steps:<br/>1. Weed out all but the very top based on GPA and standardized test scores<br/>2. Then "build your class" based on whatever diversity criteria  you wish to use (leadership, hardship, affirmative action flags etc)
The elder Tsarnaev and his brother were welcomed with open arms into a liberal community. They were provided  housing accommodation, scholarship money, even welfare. Those who knew the elder brother well observed he had become "religious". Joining a Jihadi movement and recruiting his brother and massacring non-believers was part of that process irregardless of how well they had treated him. 
Don't kid yourself. There are no "gems" in the New York City public school system.
Unlike the myriad of trendy "must try" restaurants I've been to this year (mostly very expensive Brooklyn dives with inadequate seating and service)  Manzanilla is actually a professionally run restaurant where you are seated and treated like a human being. The price points are reasonable and the executions superb. Anyone who has travelled extensively can tell you that there is no better dining than that to be found in Spain. However, for reasons unbeknown to me Manhattan modern Spaniards have generally missed the mark. With Manzanilla on the scene, New York can finally boast a first rate, modern Spanish restaurant. 
Bill's is a beautiful old time bar with great ambience and bad food. Kinda like Clarkes!
Any small business owner will tell you that this will now give worker "sunny days off". Trust me, if New York City's small business labor force is now entitled to 5 more days off with pay, they are going to take them, whether they are sick or not.
When  Mr Ahn states They have suffered the biggest pain created by the war" his ignorance nearly disqualifies him. 
I enjoyed this blog. It gave the Grammy Awards and its recipients and performers the respect they deserve.<br/>
None.
What astounds me is how GOOD they are. W is like some brilliant outsider artist, effortlessly incorporating elements of photorealism and dark surrealism. Lucian Freud, David Hockney, Pop Surrealists and PhotoRealists have nothing on him.
In an era of malignant narcissism. declaring yourself "gluten sensitive" is just another way of showing how "special" you are.<br/>
It is no wonder a bunch of quacks and nouveau junk food peddlers are  looking to cash in. 
As a lifelong New Yorker, 3d generation, I never thought I would say this but....it just isn't worth staying here. Why should a family spend upwards of $20,000/month simply to replicated a basic middle class lifestyle in a city which has now become a sea of luxury condos, chain pharmacies and ATM machines. There are better, far more interesting places to live.
Not a creep at all. A creep, irregardless of his appearance, lacks charm and a sense of humour.<br/>
This guy just needs a Dermatologist. I should know I am a dermatologist and seborrheic dermatitis is, although incurable, one of the most treatable and common conditions I see.
People are devastated. They have lost their primary residences and livelihood. For the NYTimes to sit back and trigger another round of  class warfare is beneath contempt. The people of Breezy Point and SeaGate are being revictimized. 
While all others who could, fled, the residents of communities like Sea Gate and Breezy point stayed and created something beautiful there. The fact that they live in secure neighborhoods should in no way deny them the benefits any taxpayer would expect in a time of devastation. The middle class denizens of these neighborhoods have made enormous contributions both locally and generally to this city. Let's not forget them now in time of need.
Here's an egregious loophole neither side has tackled: the carried interest loophole which allows private equity and hedge fund managers to pay cap gains rates on their income. It is absolutely egregious that these vultures, many of whom rake in hundreds of millions yearly, avoid taxes this way. Yes, it can simply be eliminated: if you have no basis in an investment then you are not entitled to claim it as interest income!
OK, so now that Wells has taken the obvious cheap shot how bout he lash out at some of the real emperors without clothes in this town? Next stop Batali!
Wait a minute. I've lived down in new orleans and I can tell ya this marathon in no way compares. Carnival time in New Orleans is part of the cultural fabric of the place. One must celebrate even if you have to second line in tears.<br/>
The NYC marathon on the other hand, is a parade of 47,000 joggers, mostly tourists. It is a narcissistic self-congratualtory orgy we can well do without. 
Wait a minute. I used to live in new orleans and i can tell ya this here marathon in no way, shape or form compares. carnival time in new orleans is part of the cultural fabric of the place and its celebration is absolutely essential, even if one must second line in tears.<br/>
the marathon is more of a  intrusion in which 47000 narcissistic joggers, mostly tourists, engage in an orgy of corporate fueled self congratulation. 
New Yorkers are suffering without basic amenities. Many have lost their homes, livelihoods and some, their loved ones.<br/>
To be further inconvenienced by thousands of narcissistic joggers right now is abhorrent. 
The best way is to look carefully for GAPS in employment history. Any unexplained gap should be carefully considered and could point to a history of mental illness.
Call the White House and Congress and demand we boycott tea. The patriots were right. It's packed with caffeine and carcinogens known to cause cancer in California and elsewhere. So let's ban tea, and declare it's only coffee from now on out. Fantastic "golden coffee" from El Salvador:<br/>

I really don't have a dog in this fight (because I am a male), but what pray tell is wrong with bras and breasts. I like about a 44 or 46 D myself, although I have known to be attracted to one or two 42's. There is another reason they are there, you know.
The trouble with teaching U.S. children in their native languages is that computer programs are written primarily in English. So if these kids are going to compete in tomorrow's society, shouldn't they be taught English. It is a very easy and flexible language, I think.
It strikes me that time is on the side of the tyrants, if you look at post-war history. Look at the time Yugoslavia's warlords spent being chased before hauled off to the Hague. I do not think human rights prosecutions have anything to do with producing more just societies. Looks to me as if battlefield victories produced quicker and certainly more efficient results. Viz: Germany today, which is a far more just society than it was after World War I. 
xxxxYou think of what these people can eat on a given day: pain au chocolat for breakfast, soupe a loignon gratinee topped by melted gruyere for lunch and foie gras for dinner, as a starter.xxx<br/>
I look around the United States and see people eating a chocolate-covered donut for breakfast, onion soup for lunch, and meatloaf for dinner. So what's the difference, except the French names. The major difference between the U.S. and European diet is they eat less and drink more than we do. Which is why diet soft drinks are so prevalent here, whereas in Europe you are considered to have medical issues if you drink diet drinks.
I don't see this as a government power issue. The issue is helping out those in trouble. You can do that without making any power grab. Also, as we have seen in recent disasters, government power to react is limited unless the military is employed. Solution: use the military to handle disaster relief because they have the equipment and expertise to get the job done. Just retire or relieve the generals and admirals who don't respond to orders quickly and efficiently.
It is hardly a fantasy that indigent people have been taken of without insurance. Look at the name  of hospitals, and you will see many have religious origins. That hints at the role churches used to have in western societies. That we are fighting over insurance policies is an indication of the advancement of the secular state, and is not really a moral issue unless you think the state is the devil.
Central banks do centralized things. That's why they call them central banks. 
I don't want to be read as being mean and selfish, but aren't we responsible for these famines in Africa by encouraging a culture of dependence on AID. I frankly don't care, because I know there is more than enough food in the world to feed these people and I've seen starvation elsewhere where it doesn't get much publicity. But this is Africa, and we all carry the guilt of the white man's burden. How sad. Let's teach them to fish and grow their own crops instead.
Bloody marvelous. From university student at the University of Nottingham to bond trader in five years. Hired as a trainee. So inquiring minds would like to know who turned him in? Was it the suspect himself, perhaps hoping to make millions publishing a book on his escapades at UBS, just like the others caught doing this have done? Come on, people, you can't have a financial system run like this and expect it to work.
I cannot believe how what started as a relatively minor hacking incident involving the parents of a missing child has blossomed into such a major brouhaha requiring Calahan to cancel his South African trip suddenly, and parliament to stay in session. I know they don't have many clear and sunny days over there for their vacations. So if the FBI is joining in the investigation, what are they going to find on this side of the pond?
I'm sorry, but our society has rules because life is so unfair. Is it unfair to punish Navy commanders who run their ships aground when they weren't even at the wheel. Should Army commanders take the fall and be denied promotions because of the unpunished misdeed of their subordinates? We have rules for immigraation, and many obey them to gain entry into this country. Vargas did not at age 12 and has taken insufficient steps since to rectify the situation. Well, I'm sorry, but there are rules and the rules are there to protect citizens like me. And I expect both formal and informal rules to be obeyed or we have no society.
In the old Soviet Union, tourists were prohibited from taking pictures of train stations and airports, presumably because these had military purposes, although probably not since World War I.  We are infected by this paranoia, too. Outside the super-secret National Security Agency at Ft. Meade, Md., there are signs warning passers-by not to take pictures of the blue-glass building and I recall some non-Americans were stopped and quizzed by the police in the wake of 9/11 after taking pictures of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. Hmmm. Why do you think they really wanted those pictures of a bridge?
Since the world's TV cameras were all focused on that Cairo square on that day, it should be easy for CBS to come up with footage documenting this assault.
This is hardly enough. The Tea Party is not living up to its promises. Where are the agency closings we were promised? What about closing the U.S. Institute of Peace and dismantling the Department of Education? What about reforms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which did nothing about Madoff in spite of being given the evidence of his wrong-doing. What about the waste and inefficiency. This budget cut only rewards do-nothing federal government employees and doesn't at all reform what is wrong with our federal spending. What a disgrace to those who voted for the Tea Party. 
Who is Katie Couric, and what is the CBS Evening News?
At last, someone has been caught with his hand in the cookie jar, and this image Warren Buffett has sought to create of the world's most ethical company is once again pierced. It is about time, in my opinion, and I hope investors will now take this into account when they consider the worth of those incredibly inflated Berkshire-Hathaway shares. The Securities and Exchange Commission needs to look closer at this transaction, as well as others made by this grossly overweight conglomerate. I also think the news media needs to reexamine its preening treatment of the "oracle of Omaha" and be more skeptical when claims of ethical business transactions are claimed. No matter what the parties in this dispute claim, using insider information to buy stocks is a violation of our laws. 
I am sure that if I was caught in the kitchen with my hand in the cookie jar, I would of course respond that I had absolutely no intention of stealing a cookie. It is the same with this case. Using your argument, we should empty out the prisons because I am sure we will find convicts convinced they weren't doing wrong when they did wrong.<br/>
I am also incredibly upset that Warren Buffett somehow gets a pass from reporters when it comes to cases like this. Might I remind reporters that we recently had one of the most respected financiers in America convicted of running a ponzi scheme. So I am not inclined to give this case a pass like reporters seem to want to. I want the Securities and Exchange Commission to do their job, not sit on their duffs as they did in the case of Bernie Madoff -- the respected financier I refer to.
Put the fear of God in them, and charge children with disseminating child pornography by sexting. After a few prosecutions, the word would get around schools that this activity is not permitted in this society, and the activity would cease. It's like shoplifting. If you tolerate young people doing it and don't prosecute, you are just encouraging others to join in. No matter the age, people have to be held accountable for their actions that violate the laws. If you don't like that, then persuade the state legislature and Congress that child pornography is acceptable.
Perhaps there's a rebellion afoot over the idea of spending $1 million for a pile of sticks manufactured from woodchips, wrapped in Tyvek paper, and then plastered over with plastic siding made from recycled milk cartons. I think people have finally seen through this fraud and no longer want anything to do with what passes as house construction today. Take a look at these suburban McMansions. They can't even get the corners square and the utility bills for heating or cooling them are simply incredible. America's housebuilders need to take a lesson from what has happened in Detroit and bring back some quality controls,

There are litmus tests here, and if Republicans don't follow through on promises, there will be retribution in the polls during the primaries and general elections next year. Brown and Murkowski may not be up for reelection next year, but many of their GOP colleagues are and if they aren't obtuse, they will see that they will get the Bob Bennett treatment in their states. Voters are fed up with politicians who seek compromise over principles. We want cuts, not Bob Bennett compromises. Allow this spending to increase, and incumbents will hear the whisper of the ax real soon. 
No problem. Just a little smoke. Where there's smoke there's fire, or someone inside the plant smoking. Nothing to worry about. Won't affect the population in the least. Those likely in danger have already been relocated. Not that they have been informed yet they are likely never to be allowed to come back. No disruption in their lives, really. Many were elderly and going into assisted living soon anyway. Absolutely no health issues involved. The U.S. State Department is giving out thryoid pills to its staff at the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo 200 miles away, but there's categorically no danger to the population. Certainly, Americans don't have anything to worry about as the clouds from the failed reactors reach America's shores and scatter particles on California fields growing vegetable distributed across the United States in winter. Don't panic and hype what has been just a minor problem. Don't be a fool and arrange for your own supply of thyroid pills. Remember nuclear power is one of the safest ways of producing electricity, with a proven track record that compares favorably to other means. Believe us, citizens, it's safe. Everything is under control. Don't worry. Just a minor glitch. 
Why is our government telling us we don't need to get possasium iodide tablets when it is giving out doses of this drug to State Department employees in Tokyo. If it's good for the goose, it's good for the gander. I think we are being lied to about the consequences of these reactor problems. Japanese officials initially sought to minimize the problem, yet now admit they have a serious problem. They have yet to acknowledge to those relocated that they are not going to be able to live in their former homes anymore. We are told that food is likely to be contaminated, yet that is said not to be a problem. What is the straight story here, NYT? We need objective and solid reporting on the problems at this plant and its consequences, not just a repeat of government lies. 
It is a disgrace that the pronouncements of public officials cannot be trusted. It only deepens public skepticism that they are not been told the whole truth on matters they fear and do not know well. We have gone through this before in our country, and presidents learned a bitter lesson about dissembling or being economical with the truth. Nothing government officials can say will match the worst fears of the public, so they must adhere to the highest levels of truthfulness. If they don't know, a no comment or I'll have to get back to you on that is much more acceptable than deliberate deception. 
The new technology bulbs are not just expensive: $34 for a bulb of similar intensity as the one I can buy for 50 cents. Plus the light is different, and not as comforting as the incandescent. You cannot stare into an LED bulb, and you cannot remove an LED bulb while it is lit with a dish towel. It is so hot it is a fire hazard. So add up the increased insurance costs, the costs of the bulb, the annual eye checkups caused by strain because it's difficult to see at night, and i think you will find these bulbs are extravantly expensive -- and wastefully expensive.
Giving up freedom to obtain security leads to no freedom and no security.  Just look at where our future government is headed, e.g.  North Korea, China, Saudi Arabia, England, Israel, Russia etc<br/><br/>Those people gave up freedom for security.  We are becoming a third world country.<br/><br/>Freedom is not free, many Americans have died for the freedoms we enjoyed and are presently being squandered,  where no brave statesmen in government stands up for the people.<br/><br/>-- Tomas Jeffereson

Our minds have limited intellect.  We will never conceptually understand the very fundamentals of everything.  We need to accept that and be humbled by it.  We probably exist in a multi-dimensional universe that may have an infinite number of  dimensions. The most a human mind can understand conceptually are 4 dimensions.  Any other explanations above 4 no matter how cleverly explained by mathematical symbols, string theory, multiverse, or space warping onto itself  is just a laughing stock.  Can you teach an ant crossing your table in the morning the concepts of calculus.  No matter how many different crumbs or pieces of sugar you lay out even given an googleplex of time, you will not be able to instruct the ant on the concepts of calculus.  The ant will never understand the concepts of a derivative or integral.  Well that's how our minds are when we go above four dimensional thinking.

PIGMENTS of our imagination, getting a BIGBANG for our bucks from the BIGBANKS!<br/>"LEI DEI, I'm your knight in shining armor and I love you!"<br/><br/>WHH<br/>PS I really felt the BERNE @ 39A and being so NEEDY,  IWISH I GARNI at least Five reco's for this comment?
Welcome back, Jane Darling, to the friendly confines of WP, where you're always warmly thought of.<br/><br/>Howie  TBOQ
John, There were two other flamboyant grapplers who were on the scene back in the late 40's at the same time as GG, and throughout the 50's, namely, "The Golden Superman" and my particular favorite "Gene 'Mr. America' Stanlee!"<br/>He, BTW, was a Chicago native, born and raised!<br/><br/>Howie
Migrant, Not even I, April Fool Numero Uno, would be foolhardy enough to engage in matching wits with LaLeapy!<br/>As a matter-of-fact, her actual likeness is posted in dictionaries around the globe next to the primary definition of "steel trap"!<br/><br/>WHH  TBOQ
But, LeapyL, I was simply going to remark on your always admirable rapier-like wit!<br/><br/>Howie, cutting away to black
Wow! spenyc, I have to say, in total awestructiveness, how utterly an assertive mood you're evidently in this Friday morn!<br/>No doubt, there's nary a drop of dairy creamer in the kitch to go with your customary cup of morning joe?<br/>Happy to report though, I found your list of queries above to be quite arresting!<br/><br/>WHH
GM, Roy Leban, Anyone who begins their comment with "I'll be brief" it's pretty much a given said comment will be read!<br/><br/>WHH
INIGO, but what doido now that I've GOTTEIN?<br/><br/>WHH
Oh, Wowie Zowie! Howie love your Bowie!<br/><br/>WHH
MTF, You bust earned a chrome plated AREOLA RINGing reco from this on the record non legman!<br/><br/>"A NODe from a Lord is breakfast for a fool"<br/><br/>"Like to the LARKs at break of day arising from sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate"<br/>IKID you not, SKIDOO should have been inserted @23A!<br/><br/>ASHES to ASHER, Dawn to Dusk!<br/><br/>Howie  TFBOEH
John, I can understand why you would be ticked, especially after hearing your tale of woe, it reminded me of that WWll novel written by Lillian Hellman, and made into a Hollywood film that starred Bette Davis and Paul Lukas titled, "Whine on the Watch"  Hee Hee Hee<br/><br/>WHH
I say, John Boy!  Why has all the attention been focused upon by the LOL Insurance johnnies, down through the years, on the shapely pins of Hollywood actresses, have they ever been approached to insure the outstanding bosomy attributes owned by the likes of Mae West, Jane Russell, Jayne Mansfield, etc, etc.<br/>Since many good things come on pairs...we legions of non legmen demand parity!<br/><br/>Careful, Howie, after all, you are aware, Sir, are you not, that you've been tittering on the brink all this week here in WP?
Jimbo, You got that right, good buddy, as Bru definitely seems to strike us both, as one truly CUtE guy!<br/><br/>Howie
Good Morning, suejeanLUV, can it possibly be, that these two frightfully clever chaps 'ad you solely in mind when they 'appened to dedicate this XWDP way across the SEAs in Dear Old 'arrogate?<br/><br/>'Owie
There must be a mystery mentor cell watching this planning to channel his next victim.<br/>I do not think this increase of attacks to maim many are not isolated incidents. eg Murrah, Eurora, Newton, VA Tech, Columbine, Gabrial Giffords Maybe mind control drugs or some form of vudu or brain washing system. Or maybe even channeling mind control. It seams all these people were under some form of possession or spell of hypnotism. Weak minded easily influenced individuals already fused by resentment, bitterness, hate, fear, with an aim to justify by violence. Karl Marx made a social science out of this and converted two thirds of the World population. It took a hundred years for people to realize there is no conflict in polarities . They are in perfect harmony and cooperation  Einstein ended the theory and created the opposite chain reaction by splitting the atom. My biggest question is . What was Terrorism doing all the years of the cold war. The Berlin wall fell without a fight.<br/>I always felt the American way was we are here to show you a better way . As JFK amicably said " Don't ask what the World can do for your country ask only what your country can do for the World.<br/>I only wish we had been as prepared for 911 as the show of cooperation and unity so vigilantly and miraculously displayed in Boston. The power of  good is truly greater than the power of evil.
This proves if Jesus came again he would be crucified again. Judaism ended when Jesus walked out of the river and began again.<br/>
Ignorance is bliss. no wonder there no forgiveness in Israel. War is not an answer.<br/>
We are all the chosen people now.<br/>
The Messianic age is over. Agnostic means to believe Jesus did not come to die but to live.<br/>
Agnostic means the resurrection was Spiritual and not Physical.<br/>
But I agree only God is good and we should follow Him&gt;Her in our Hearts and no man Person or Place.
Money talks and bull walks .<br/>
In a debate specifics are essential, Mojo is also important. I always feel its similar to boxing. When your hit with a hard punch, you must immediately counter punch with fury and make your opponent feel his best shots have had no effect. This is a psychological tactic even though your hurting. Romney had him at the git go and knew Obama was out to lunch with his sweety and felt guilty . The salvation of our country was in the way of the anniversary dinner and sucked all the energy out of the room. Seek ye first the elimination of romper room boy and let all other things fall into place.<br/>
But I think Obama won because he did not let himself get out of control even though I felt he wanted to drop the anchors.<br/>
Romney showed his true colors a chameleon . I hope before the next debate Obama has a steak dinner and stops the veggie diet sweety has him on . Lots of coffee not decaff real caffeine coffee. 
Good conclusion .<br/>
The GOP are also only interested in one Job Obamas.<br/>
God save us all.
Torture was to force confessions to justify war.<br/>
Marx and Engles used dialectical materialis, tricked two thirds of the World population into consensual totalitarianism.<br/>
Cheney is sliding under the fence of converting the Legislative and the Courts under the Executive being the underlying destruction of The US.<br/>
It was treasonable to betray a soldier in the White House.Valary Plame.<br/>
There was no WMD and the Iraq war was planned long before the 911 ever occurred like day one of the Bush Admin.. Ten thousand Marines are dead and one hundred thousand are wounded. The Iraqi citizens 65,000 dead and a million wounded. Three million fled and will not be home soon. .<br/>
Its ironic Tony Blair's World Book Tour was banned in Ireland.The liar claimed he only entered the Iraq war after the 911 happened . The big elephant in the kitchen was who wrote the Downing st memos and who underpinned the fake info you all dished out to Sec Gen Colin Powell.<br/>
The Americans should stop this war monger unleashing a lying legacy of slf justification of slf pitty he could not make an enviormmental disaster that would crush the World in a clean up effort for a thousand years. ..<br/>
He should be tried for putting our boys and girls in harms way unnecessarily.
These tyrannical junta Dictators have fallen so low when you see Mubarak dragged in ,in a stretcher to face killing 300 of his people in Tahrir Square and Assad is looking on as Qaddafi is hiding among the girl guides dresses in the School Convent.<br/>
42 years of oppression and terror ends a Feudal Monarchic system and gives birth in democratising the Globe..<br/>
lately I am proud of America in Wisconsin activating peaceful demonstration in toppling totalitarians using our constitutional rights.<br/>
Yes we can demonstrate the will of the people in a dubious time when our truths are not so self evident. With out sacrifice our system does not work it was not designed to have rich people inherit a legacy to hand down to mad sons.<br/>
In god we trust.<br/>
The wealth increased.<br/>
The spirit betrayed.<br/>
The house divided.<br/>
What does it profit.<br/>
On that Day His Love shall Overwhelm.<br/>
please America bring my children home.
The lady of satirical eloquence in essence has evolved into a masterful critic.<br />Happiness is still the shadow of love.<br /><br />I think when Jesus walked out of the Jordon, John should have also followed. Our only hope is to know the Messianic age is over and all mankind are the chosen people. We all need a fresh start.<br />Thanks Maureen,What a job. great stuff. Nailed it.<br /><br />
Thanks Frank for saying it like it is. I wish I could write like that. This a fantaboulous article.Great Job i hope Obama and crew read this It is simple and presents a clear picture. Look if Obama took prisoners the result would be worse than the violent reaction we have now. The point is we now have something done. This is not about the American people it's about who's in charge. Loosing Teds seat to Brown woke up the Dems to vote HCR or lose an election . We got the consolation prize with no public option. We the people get the short end when they try and repeal in the name of state rights. This is about race and who is in charge and nothing else. look at the coincidence Greenspan and irregularity is the same time frame as Reagan.
This is all about action replay. JFK got tough and blew Vietnam . Obama must not fall into the same trap. Just keep them trapped in along the third inside rail exposing the Party of NO and getting plenty of gas milage on the dead Health Care issue. Ha Ha If we never got health Care would the Economy be reformed Ha ha. Maureen, you are getting to them. They are on the run,it's clear from the defencive response. The word on the street has great talking points. 
Maybe if we consider all is polarity and male and female he made them in His own image. Adam and Eve walked and talked with God in the cool of the evening. Evil only showed up after the fall. God said don't eat the fruit or you die. We did, and no one died. Consider no evil existed before the fall. The commandment must have been a guide to inherit perfect creativity. Not a choice. Eve did not choose to fall she was beguiled tricked by a serpert a devil an Arc Angel. A Male Spititual being that made the World with God. Adam fell to Eve breaking the commandment and falling into a self centered love relationship. The history is just repeating itself all over the world for all time. My analagy is trying to portray the story. It was not the apple on the tree it was the pare on the ground. God said he accepted Abels offering and regected Cain. This time someone died. Noah got drunk and blew his position of a new begining of only eight people. Abraham blew his position and fell asleep and forgot to cut the birds. Not killing his son redeemed him but slavery prevailed for four hundred years. Joseph was betrayed by all his brothers. Jacob stole a birthright and a blessing with the help of his Mother. Ishmael was thrown out in the dirt. Moses killed an Egyptian , smashed his ten commandments, and struck the rock twice forbiding him to enter the Promised Land. Prostitutes helped Joshua and caleb to enter the The Promised land. John the Bapist asked if jesus was the one or should we look for another.Jesus answered John is the least in the Kingdom of Heaven. Jesus was murdered and condemned for sedition not one single charge held against Him not even the blind kid. I thought the purpose of Christianity was to prepare for the Second Christ. I do no think we are ready. If we prepare as a thief in the night we might be introduced to Heavenly Father and Mother God. My point is Council of Women or anybody should be in Groups. It's time for Mother Chuech to realise a new ae has begun in the midts of great confusion . There is no chosen person, people ,culture, nation , Religion, or Church. All mankind are Gods Chosen people. We are all restored little Adams and Eves returning in love in this complete resurrection Two by Two. Spiritual eternity is a reality.   
It's plain to see nobody knows what is going on. Imagine if she was the VP of our Nation overreving on a Peter principle. "Can I call you Joe". Look it's time we the People compliment ourselves on the Presidential Choice. Mc Cain is exposed as a man choosing a mad woman to handle the VP position of this Nation. Dead fish go with the flow but fiecies always floats. The resounding words of Bill Clinton in the Denver Convention are slowly kicking in. You People are on the wrong side of History. More important to me right now is shovel ready job's and the 10% unemployment rate . Please spend the stimulus package. America needs action right now.
This is just a public defence daughter and all to deter a legal criminal investigative battle, that may result in prosecution. Bill was impeached for a spot on a blue dress. To change history and preserve a legacy is this the motive for all this fan fair. This guy wants to go down in history as the Lord Protector. We know he was President. He thinks he was president George knows he was the Dogs body. Torture is usually to get people to tell what they know. These techniques were used to extract false confessions from people to say Alquaeda was connected to teaching people to manufacture WMDlinking WMD to Saddam ie; Gen Sec Powell presentation in the UN to justify WMD. The Valery Plame eposide blew the whistle. These people had to justify War. There was no WMD and the war in iraq was planned long before 911 ever happened. The 911 Comission clearly states no connection with Alqaeda and Saddam. Remember how Bush 41 said the war in Kuwait was a just war and we were a kinder gentler Nation. Who said we cut and and run, who is cutting and running now. it's only ironic to see Cheney wants the memos released to say torture worked and Obama is second guessing not to release pictures of tortured people. The justification of violence is Marxist Dialectical Materialism. The entire Engles Marx philosophy is based on the justfication of violence. I pray for the new administration to follow a pathway of peace. We must consider eight Nations have nukes. Any man in this age has to be stark raving mad to solve problems with choice one torture viloence and war. The truth is this guy was the President and he will let every body go down with blood in their hands. The thing is two wrongs does not make a right. We thought all along Cheney was transfering the power of the Judicary to the power of the Executive. I think this was the main issue not waterboarding. It's like the transfer of debt transfered from Wall St Bankers to Main St Tax Payers. Then the wrong issue becomes Corp Bonus. Wag the dog. Red became Blue hopfully for the next forty years. Carvelle might have a point to his new book. 
12 million Emmigrant's. 12 Million Unemployed. 12 million don't have health Care. Is this a new game of bait and switch. We refinanced the Banks so who picked up the tab on the toxic asset's. Mr Krugman if the Dow Jones is nearly at a staedy 9 and the price of a barrel of oil is $50 for six months straight how come the Fed Rate is not kicking in. All of a sudden has imports and exports got an effect on our GDP. We can't understand that the subprime mortgages had such an effect on our world global and transnational economy. Even five million foreclosures does not add up to this great calamity. Five million at $150,000 a shot does not even add up to the first tarp payment and now they want us to anti up again. Are we there yet. Are we there yet. Are we there yet.<br />Beware of Greek's bearing Gift's. To big to fail. Remove this phrase from our political dictionary. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS LUCK THE PREPARATORY WORK OF THE CLINTON'S AND TED KENNEDY COMBINED WITH THE OPPOTUNITY OF THE OBAMA PHENOMENON MUST BE WED. THE MARRIAGE MUST TAKE PLACE. Health said "I do" to Care. Illegal Wars cost as much. Tough Love hurt's. Now we know the nature of the beast, Katrina and Ab yu Graib were not the downfall. " To say thoes who are not with me are against me" was. This kind of leadership frightened off 187 National allie's and united our enemie's against us. To be an emigrant is torture. To be out of work is torture. To have no Health care is torture. Now we have given all the oven ready Cake's to the big wig's. Where's all the shovel ready job's. Let's get the led out. 
The first thing to do is teach everybody to regect a Party of no and don't vote for them for Forty years. Banish The GOP from representing people as a Party. I mean revoke their license. Red card no play in the next game. They have been driving drunk on the wrong side of the road for to long. They turned our bank's into Casinoe's The party of no has swown latley meaning Cheney especially to justify himself and not care for the American People. If I go down I will bring you all down with blood on everyones hand's. If you think you won an Election I will make shure you inherit a Global situation that guarantees faliure. Did That. The cards dished out to Obama were ripped from a stacked deck. If we cant have it nobody can. Reagan's wife came up with an empty slogan for people on drugs twenty years ago " Just say no to drug's". Now they laugh at us again with a new slogan for the Homeless. "Get a God Dam House.".<br />I cant take it any more when I read in The New York Times Yesderday. Israel had Nukes, war heads by the hundreds all along. I wondered why The Whole World watched the Mascure and slaughter of Gaza. No one could take them on. I hope obama has the gaul to shoot them down if they break Iran air space. We might have a Billion mad people with guns raging in the middle east. We were all led to believe Iran had one nearly. Maddof is the only guy in Jail for all this mess. Whats up. A half million a month out of work is torture. It used to be 12 million don't have health care now it's twelve million don't have job's. Does this mean we dont need health care. What happened to all the shovel ready projects. Let's get some of the led out. Obama should know the Obstructionists are creating as many distractions as possible to offset his plan . Go Obama, Go Obama. Go Obama. When opportunity meets preperation. That what a job is. There is no such thing as luck. Let's Roll. We are ready willing and able. 
So Condi was just conveying,transmitting,delivering,orders for the White House. Condi now is a conduit following orders in the wake of Colin Powell's resignation. Can she now freely convey to us why she stonewalled the 911 commisssion. One minite you have a flowing conduit and the next a backed up suer. Shame on us if we think black people don't know what torture is. This kind of torture was designed to extract a confession from people to confirm Alqueda was in iraq to justify a War planned from day one before 911 happened with no WMD. Now we have 4270 marines dead over 30,000 wounded , 650.000 Iraque civilians dead. 6 million displaced. and the middle east in a mess. This technique backfired on Pilate when he tortured Jesus, he hoped the people would feel sorry for him and guarantee his release with a pardon. Unfortunatly the mob ruled. Then he washed his hands to save his Position.  
What a fabulous article Mr Herbert. We must continue to remind ourselves to keep the ten yards down. The GOP should be forbidden to represent people for forty years on the grounds they might incriminate themselves. Churchill said in the WW2 "This is your finest hour". Obama inherited a mess and we need jobs yesderday. I for one felt during the Campaign The Party of NO were trying to make a World War Platform to facilitate The son of an Admiral fitting for a war hero. When the platform of terror did not work down went Lehman Bros, yet another ploy to stop the General Election. You must admit when you heard slogans like Bomb,Bomb,bomb Iran, Or We are all Georgians,Or I have posponed my Election Campaign. The biggest divide in America was not Sunday morning at eleven but how Bush and Mc Cain could not meet for fundraisers. My opinion is the GOP showed shame for their own Party from the Getmo. Abu Graib and Kathrina was bad but to say you never expected an attack on The Twin Towers was worse when we were hit in the same building by the same crowd in 1997. I was there. They tried to bomb the basement colums to bring the building down. I think Condi stonewalled lots of info regarding this point to cover up innaction. Three silver bullets could have changed lots of things when they surrounded Bin Laden in Afganistan. My math might be off but Five Million written off Foreclosed Homes at approx 150,000 Dollars a shot is no where near 3.2 Trillion. Or even TARP 7 bill or The Stimilus Package 8 bill. Are we just holding on to a standard of living to keep the Banks on the dole.    
macro or micro econonics, I'm lost "you had me at the fed rate is not funtioning and has no effect on the fluctuation of the elasticity of trade. The Hydron Cholider is up and running again at the end of May.They fixed the freeon Gas leak, more wiered science . We all know the effect of the chain reaction of splitting an attom. Or financing a War for no reason. I think to race atoms into each other at many times the speed of light to experiment what might happen is crazy. The big magnets are supposed to measure the carbon deposits or a new kind of diamond maybe. These guys are having a shot at finding out how God made the World or what is the answer to the theory of the big black hole. At the same time the 2012 metorite is moving past between the sun and the earth the pressure of these events could also be melting the ice and pushing us off our axis. I learned my economics from my mother she said inflation is when you spend beyond your means. I would rather this atomic experiment be carried out in outer space not fifteen miles inside our planet in Europe. Enough. 
Has the Downing St Memo anything to do with the death of Patrick Kelly. I saw an interview between Sir David Frost and Gordon Brown last week in London redredging the facts on the heels of the G20. They were planning to reinvestigate why The Brits were in the Iraq war in the first place. We must consider four investigations already took place including the famous Huntington Report to no avail. The Brits pulled their troops out this week and one hundred people died in Bagdad. Its true what this article is  saying, this baby is not going to bed. There was no WMD and the illegal War in Iraq was planned day one of the Bush Administration according to Bill Woodward's book, Wash Post editor. long before 911 ever happened. Im not looking at memos I'm looking at the shambles of the middle East,The Afgan and Pakistan debockle. Not to mention The Economic Meltdown. Lets face it it was a debt moved from Wall St to Main St Tax Payers with plenty of memos and blame to go around. Pelosi knew is the new defence so the Party of no conclude as usual two wrongs make a right. The great leadership quality of the Bush administration was to unite all our enemies against us. well you might say he did not make a world war ,or stop the general Election. Thank God for not privatizing Social Security. Cheney needs to know the two Gospels, John the Baptist was beheaded for accusing King Herod for sleeping with his brothers wife. simultaniously Jesus was forgiving Mary Magdelene for Adultry, same sin. They were of total opposite persuasions of thought. To me this symbolizes the two doctrines eye for eye and tooth for tooth is replaced by Obama's doctrine a win ,win solution of forgivness and love if you repent. But then again Jesus was crusified so in the end its up to the people of the peope by the people for the people. This time lets not do things right but lets "do the right thing". Imagine if Puncious Pilate had not washed his hands that day and took resposibility, we should not wash our hands of this and let history continue to repeat itself. This Pig is wearing purple eye shadow with FLU like symtoms with epidemic pandemic consequences. This is not an isolated incident it pertains to our Constitution. You cannot move forward with a leaky radiator hose in just a few miles you will have no engine. 
I thought Amendments could be amended by a Refurendum.<br />It's not like legal memos that look like they approve torture to cover your touch in the event of protest,<br />Your article is like the expose of the torture memos but where is the political will of the people. Our moral conscience does not have the steel girders to hold up and underpin the architectural social design. We have gone global with people whom are undisiplined with no regulation or moral conscience. The rules cant even rule Pirates. As long as morality is not entertained into the equasion of Democracy it wont work, This is why we need guns. Evil and God were not part of Karl marx system of Dialectical Materialism, his Social Science left out two major components.It fell because it did not make sense. 76 million people died in WWII, This tells me there is evil, Without the sacrificial endevour of sacrifical people Democracy will not work, Greed and imorality is devouring our great experiment. Obama might say we are not a Christian nation but without the moral development of the charactar of our hearts and spirits, This article will be written next year statistically in greater numbers to no avail. We failed Jesus he did not fail us we left God He never left us. Matt 5,48 You therefore can be perfect as your heavenly Father in Heaven is perfect. Let us strive to build a more Perfect Union.  
Why pick on the Irish. We only have three million citizens an one million Latvians and Polish working for nothing. A slave society with a false sense of economic confidence. You have 250 million people kicking out the Mexicans and you have the moxy to compare yourself to the Irish. I know what you are saying is your self justification our selfishness matches our greed. The great combination that led us down into the pit. Eve was in the Garden looking for a more mature love relationship and found a feel sorry for yourself selfish jelous Satan in the bushes. Adam had not yet discovered his stimulus package. We never even got our fourth of july yet from the British. While you revive your Tea Parties in disruption for the Party of NO. Reveal your sins of Torture but not what the banks did with the TARP MONEY. Double standard. I ALWAYS THOUGHT CONTINGENCY PLAN WAS AN ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT PLAN REFERING TO PLAN B. THE NEW NAME FOR THE WAR ON TERROR. And by the way "La go bragh" means "It's a beautiful day". Did you know Tached cottages are the in thing now and we dont have pigs in the kitchen. Think of it we survived worse than this we used to have eighteen million people before the potato Famine. Now 20% of the population of the US is Irish. That's like one fifth, yes forthy million. Dont fool yourself into thinking Obama got there by the Black vote. Hey Krughman go pick on someone your own size. Fell sorry for yourself someplace else.   
This article is just to get us off Tea bags and Torture.<br />one thing is for shure if this Administration is to move to the next meal. Let's clean off the table. This Emporor never had any clothes. 
Hey Bono .<br /> "It's a beautiful day".<br /> We must compliment The Bush regime that led us down into the pit for three things. 1 He did not start a World War. 2 He did not privatize Social Security. 3 He did not stop the General Election. I don't like Bush but I'm against the blame game. Christianity had a mission to prepare for Christ and no one was ready introducing Communism and three world wars. Now The Southern Bapist Christian right, Our Congress and Senate including the British Parlement and many nations voted for the War in Iraq. The blame game does not work. We must look at ourselves and participate in the process. My mantra is there was no weapons of mass destruction and the war in Iraq was planned from day one of the Bush administration long before 911 ever took place. I hope the world ignoring the Gaza mascure does not give the moxy to Natanyahu to bomb, bomb, bomb, Iran. Otherwise we could have an echological disaster that would take one thousand years to clean up.<br /><br />Thanks Bono, and your great group U2. You do the Irish proud we truly love you for all that you do. I read your Da was the guy who believed in you guy's and gave you the few quid to cut the first album. I would not argue with him we all owe him. He made you guys and believed in you all. Some day you will talk to me I'm a Dubliner thats been around and God has given me a message for you He told me He loves you and a time will come and you will know it's me it shall be revealed to you thoes three special words . "He is here".<br /><br />Kieran O'Neill. "Yea The O'Neill Clan". 
O Yea. Where is Universal Health care promised by<br />CLINTON,OBAMA,AND KENNEDY. Dashel is gone now whats up. The big 20 dump a trillion on the world sceen. 12 million have no Health Care in the US. The Clintons promised with no delivery in their tenure. Whats up. Wagnor got a 20 million golden parachute. Yea we were angry about the last eight years. The Pentagon did not reduce costs and eliminate expenses to justify a war. The biggest problem to balance the budget is being shoved in our faces as the reduction of Health Care expences. Nobody said anything in balancing a budget for the unjust war. We want Universal Health Care yea 12 million People. Dont start explaining us away all thoes in Europe have it. Smiles and phychology did not get this administration where they want to be. They promised health Care. Now it's being explained away. We haven't seen a first down. All we see is nuclear warheads flying over japan. Not to mention Iran shooting up a sputnic latley. After 911 why even take a chance. These guys could scramble our communications. 
Two commedians made a name for themselves and pumped up their ratings calling us out without laughing. This is the cost of doing business. Whats the big polemic. This is not a Katrina moment. This is a malox moment after eight years of Bush and failed policies. You cannot expect Obama to be called out on every toilet roll missing from the bathroom. I doubt he will say I screwed up on this one. If it's not Rent on a limo a lapsed tax payment or 2% Porky the Pig it is seen to be perfect obstructionism that ties up the boat at the dock as we rev full steam ahead making lots of white splashing water going nowhere. Ironically some of the Republicans are for paying the bonuses now.  The Republicans are so elated to have a new whipping boy Geithner to defame the ratings of a popular President. Look they got one in the basket. Even in basket ball people win on technical fouls. Whats the big polemic on miniscuel bonuses that can be retracted when the real problem is eighteen years of no regulation creates an AIG monster in forty seven foreign foreign countries with a budget four times bigger than Home Land Security. look don't sweat the small petti stuff it's just the cost of doing business in the age of corruption. What shall become of us if God forbid Michelle surges with a splurge to buy new dishes for the White House. The more things change the more they stay the same. One thing I would suggest is everybody is on Geitner and rightly so expressing how techy and smart he is but he lack's the art of salesmanship. Have you ever seen what happens to your sales when you let the mechanic talk to the customers. We need to sell the sizzle not the grizzle. I will be sad for America if the hard working successful people are punished for being successful.     
Hey Blow, a plough horse and a race horse both eat grass. The thing is the race horse makes more money. I can't shoot hoops like Mike Jordon or score goals like Becham. The American dream is we are not punished for being successful. if these guys got busted they must have been a bubble. The thing is this is OUR money and these are the very guys that sank the Titanic lieing cheating and stealing sticking it to us taking the most for the least. These guys did not earn this money we did and we lent it to them in hope. To big to fail is a treat we fell for. This culture of no regulation in the last eighteen years got so big and arrogant it bloated out Companies like AIG to be four times the size of The budget of Home land Security and fanged out it's tazor edge teeth and claws into forty six Countries around the globe. We must humble to the arrogance and quickly blame ourselves and pamper it's pride and feed them with big bonuses or else we are told the world would stop. I don't mind bailing out the boat but this is our boat. Obama gets it it's Global. Thanks for your candor allowing us to vent our anger but I don't think the word in your first paragraph should be "Gambled" it should be "SABOTAGE". I STILL THINK LEHMAN BROS WAS THE HOSTAGE THROWN OFF THE PLANE TO ENSURE SERIOUS DISCUSSION FOR TARP, SO AS THEY COULD FLY AWAY WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE'S TAX DOLLARS. When you mess with the system it bites you. Just like the smartallic school children moved the clock forward an hour to get out of school early. The next morning the were all late for school. The system is so broken that when they cry wolf we kill the shepard. Obama is not worried about rocking the boat but lets get this boat off the rocks. How can we go fullsteam ahead when the party of NO consistently tie up the boat at the dock. Last week Dashel went down for not payin rent on a limo now we have no health care Zaar. The week before we dealth with 2% Porkey the Pig. This is not a time to tax Taxes on money we invested to create credit. What will it be O God forbid if Michele splurges and buys new dishes for the white House. Yes we Can.    
So what is there to negotiate? The ACA is the law of the land. What you and the R's are saying is "if you don't give me your money, you are provoking me to shoot you and if I do you will me responsible for you murder".<br/>You obviously have on idea what this is about.
With all due respect, this is a bogus comment. First, if you have healthcare through your employer you are considered covered. Next, there are no fines of 9.5% if you do not have healthcare. This is more misinformation put out by the Republicans.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.healthcare.gov" title="www.healthcare.gov" target="_blank">www.healthcare.gov</a>   --for accurate information
I am reminded of the scene of great rejoicing ,in Gone With the Wind" when the news of the firing on Ft. Sumter brought great rejoicing. We all know how that turned out.
To Robert Brown<br/>Nothing is going to stop the ACA. It will start , on schedule , on Tuesday, Oct. 1.That's the pity of this entire charade-- people like you have been bilked by the Republicans. If the shutdown continues and the government defaults due to the Republican's reckless behavior, there will be negative consequences for them.<br/>" Most Americans are rejoicing..."? Hogwash.
Mr. Culbertson said it all " Like 9/11, let's roll". It is a mockery to suggest that his actions are akin to those who attempted to thwart the hijacking.
To Know It All-<br/><br/>So we either get rid of the ACA or we shut the govt. down or we don't raise the debt ceiling. Why do we need elections? Why pass law?. Let's just propose an alternate course of action, at the last minute, after many votes to defund a law that has already been funded. Let's not forget to throw in the Republican economic platform of 2012 into the mix-- Obama needs to be reasonable, and he should accept what the R's want and, if he doesn't--well, he's pigheaded.<br/>I am reminded of what Lincoln said in 1859 at a speech at the Coopers Union. The South had said that they would secede  if a Republican were elected. The South had threatened to secede on other issues, also enumerated in that speech. Lincoln made the analogy that the South's position was like  a highwayman who says that if you are shot because you refuse to hand over your money, you will be at fault, not him. Judging from the comments of reasonable people , it's easy to see why extortion works.
To Andrea E<br/>What specific questions have not been answered? 
What, exactly, are the lies.? Most of the misinformation comes from articles like this. R's continue to fabricate "fact" like this article and her reference, for example, to Avik Roy's so-called figures.
More right wing talking points without a shred of evidence. I always wonder how such nonsense gets past the moderator when my nonsense doesn't.
Perhaps governments around the world could emulate the US Congress for non-partisanship. We certainly don't spend " precious time and resources on public relations to convince people through misinformation and misdirection to be ignorant" of laws.
   I thoroughly enjoyed Mr. De Martino's article on Sicilian  politics. Sicily , unfortunately will not change, sine the system of corruption  appears to be too ingrained. We are talking about a couple of hundred years of Mafia influence. My grandparents were born in Sicily and I have made five visits. I have always felt safe there and have never been threatened in any manner.<br/>   There was an incident in Palermo the last time my wife and I were there. About four or five people, two were handicapped , refused to allow traffic to move at an important intersection, near the train station. Traffic was held up for over an hour and a melee ensued between two of the traffic stoppers and a motorist.<br/>The motorist was beaten as his wife screamed "they are killing him". He jumped back into his car. The police, on the scene did nothing to help the man or to get the traffic moving again. My understanding was that these people wanted payment to allow traffic to move again.<br/>   The incident is reflective of the problems that face Mr. Crocetta since most on lookers just shrugged their shoulders, indicating that this is the behavior expected from the police.<br/>   I love Sicily and will return this Spring.
Have you ever noticed how many professional athletes who command a high salary whine when the are subject to criticism about there performance? They just don't get the respect that they deserve.
$31 million per year figures to be about $300,000 per RBI or about $ 3 million per home run. I don't blame him for trying to get as much as he can, it's called capitalism. The issue is whether anyone is dumb enough to pay him that much.
What exactly do the critics of this agreement think we should do? We could always go to war so that we can have peace.
Munich indeed. Seems like many of those commenting need a history lesson. Also, it's always interesting to see those who want to do" something more" to Assad, but when Americans are asked their response is to stay out of it. We have had several apples out of that bag and that is quite enough , thank you.
   What a misleading article. Ms. Turner quotes Avik Roy's article as the basis for her assertion that rates will increase "97 to 99 percent for men and and for younger women by an average of 55 to 62 percent." As Paul Krugman and Ezra Klein and others have pointed out, Roy's figures are bogus. Klein points out that not only is Roy comparing apples and oranges, he's comparing " oranges that you cannot even buy.<br/>   Next, in paragraph six, Ms. Turner says that the subsidies will be paid for by higher taxes and higher deficits. What about the benefits gained through lower health costs?<br/>   Finally, Ms. Turner uses a series of talking points used by Conservatives without citing her sources.<br/>   Will there be glitches in the program? Of course. Will they be addressed? Certainly. Ms. Turner is arguing that there should a delay to address such issues. Why haven't the Republicans addressed these issues in the past? The reason is evident--they are in favor of repeal and not improvement. We had an election that focused on healthcare and we know  how that turned out. 
     I am amazed to read this column in the NY Times. First, she cites a work by Avic Roy as for the basis of her contention that Obamacare costs will be higher than those projected by the CBO. Ezra Klein generally refutes the argument made by Mr. Roy in a face to face meeting with him. Next, Ms. Turner states that subsidies aren't free and that they are a dead weight on the economy. Not exactly, if health costs go down the more money will be available to spend in the marketplace. Last, of course there are going to be glitches and these will be addressed as the program moves forward. Ms. Turner can't resist adding Republican talking points about millions of employers cutting hours when facts don't match her rhetoric.<br/>     We had an election and among the important issues was Obamacare --and we know who won that.
To Mr. David H Eisenberg<br/><br/>I agree with you. I find that, as you read the commenters about this article and about what we should do, many have a axe to grind , have a conspiracy theory readily available or affix blame based on ideology.
Let's see--- Morsi is elected in Egypt in ,apparently, free elections  However, he is dumped by the military and this is a good thing because it is better to dump those who are duly elected because a military regime is the lesser of two evils. It seems like only those regimes whom we favor should be allowed to exist rather than those who are elected.
I would think that the term "moderate rebel" is an oxymoron.
President Obama did the right thing in not sending arms to the Syrian rebels and that decision was proven to be correct based on this article. To say that "Obama and Co. " is responsible for the extremists  is simplistic and an exaggeration. I am reminded of the 1950's when President Eisenhower refrained from giving Hungarian rebels support against the USSR. He was criticized in this country by zealots who thought that we should have become more involved.
Exactly which leadership did you have confidence in and when?
To Jp<br/>How do you know that it is a disaster since it has not been fully implemented?
I did not know that  problems in the ME started in 2009 . Apparently, everything was going great until President Obama took over. It's obviously his fault that he extended a hand to Rouhani  who snubbed the President. Also, how dare President Obama not bomb Syria and work with the Russians to get control of Syrian chemical weapons. Don't we understand that trying to work with people leads to nowhere. We need more of" you are either with us or against us" thinking and  react accordingly . I wonder what Ms. Dowd proposes that we do - since she knows what we shouldn't do.  
Exactly .Most  have forgotten how our invasion of Iraq was going to lead to a democracy in the center of the region which would reduces the influence of Iran and we would be greeted  as liberators. Mencken said something to the effect that no one ever won a bet by betting on the intelligence of the American people. How quickly we forget how we got here .
Most intelligent, hard working, news-accuracy confirming voters realize by now that Obamas legacy will be a sad one.  Here was a perfect, once in a lifetime opportunity for Blacks in America to do MLK proud by helping elect as Americas first black President, one who would bring our country together.  <br/><br/>Instead, since his election in 2008, the first black ever to serve in the highest office in our land has tragically divided our nation along political, racial, class and gender lines.  In 2012, this individual, with a slick tongue was re-elected, not by the Caucasian majority, who had apathetically turned their backs on the voting booths, but instead by those on food stamps and those Blacks who apparently really didnt care about the future of the country, as long as one of them was back in. <br/><br/>What a missed opportunity!  Given his legacy, and the damage he has done to our nation, and its place on the World stage, I doubt there will be another Black elected to the Office of the President for many, many generations to come. I really feel he has tarnished his race, and the wonderful legacy left by MLK.
What better indicator that the U.S. is in serious decline as a political, economic and military power than events that have evolved over the past 5 years.  And clearly, the rate of decline has now started to accelerate. Unfortunately narcissism amongst the politically elite , and naivety within the voting public have blinded America, much as events in Roman times foreshadowed the fall of their empire.<br/><br/>As a Canadian, with many American friends, it saddens me to see the rapid deterioration of a once great country.  Here we are a resource based economy, and are already looking East and West for new partnerships.<br/><br/>20  30 years ago few of us living in our global community would have predicted the accelerating collapse of the American way of life.
As a Canadian I have to chuckle when I see the U.S. politically elite thumping their chests about taking the moral high ground, and being the worlds guardian of morals, values and ethics.<br/><br/>The current U.S. political structure has to be the most corrupt in the world today.<br/><br/>And a final note.  The U.S. has not won a war since it participated with the Allies in WW2.  You lost in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, Egypt, Libya, and you will lose in Syria.  You should be ashamed of yourselves.  The outside world has, in 5 short years, lost all respect for America.  You voted for this dolt who leads you.  Now you deserve what you get.  
OK it's now dead.  Move on with more important matters.  The Constitution has survived another attack.
OK it's now dead.  Move on with more important matters.  The Constitution has survived another attack.
The truth hurts!  Americans have to make a choice between FREE HANDOUTS ... and FREEDOM.<br/><br/>Once these entitlement types, backed by the left-wing AARP and media get a taste of the Soviet era life, they may finally wake up.  But by then it will be too late.
The truth hurts!  At least Gov. Romney can be trusted. The problem is that the sheep of the democratic regime cannot stand the truth!

He'll likely take it from the policemens' union fund.  Isn't that the Chicago way?
I could not expect a better team to lead America during these tough times than Romney and Ryan.  What a race to come! What a great year!  Finally a breath of fresh air.<br/><br/>America has a choice now.  Whether we want the next four to mirror the last four, or whether we want to return to a positive, united, and prosperous nation.<br/><br/>The electors will decide their future in Nov.  I sure hope they make the right choice.

As we say in hockey ..."No guts, no glory".  that's why Romney has been a successful leader in business, and will make a great President. <br/><br/>Obama lacks both!  
What a class act. Pres. Bush knows that if he were to attend, the Democratic zealots would twist the occasion just as they twist everything else. Past democratic presidents lack that class. <br/><br/>You can bet however that he fully supports President-to-be Romney, and will assist in whatever ways he can.... behind the scenes. Sure would be nice if certain previous Presidents had the same class.
Your "News" article title suggests sadly that blacks don't have the ability to choose the best candidate, but instead are like sheep, easily led.<br/><br/>There are many of us who blindly supported Obama in 2008, admittedly because he was a brother.  Now I'm embarrassed that we may well have set back all the progress that we've  worked so hard to improve on over the past 50 years.  <br/><br/>His term in office will go down in history as a major disappointment, and sadly I won't likely see another brother in the Oval Office before my time has passed.   No wonder race relations here are in such a mess.
My suggestion is to:<br/><br/>1] eliminate the dividend tax credit, and<br/>
2] tax capital gains at the marginal tax rate<br/><br/>That would shut Buffett up real fast.  He doesn't take a salary but instead is paid dividends and given options.  No wonder he has a lower tax rate than his secretary.<br/><br/>In addition:<br/><br/>3] implement a progressive VAT, with the only exemptions being zero tax on food (purchased at the supermarket), minimum tax on purchased meals under say $25 per person (that makes fast food affordable for families)<br/><br/>4] cut the mortgage interest tax deductibility immediately to 50%, and eventually to 20%
It is one thing for a person to see your face in public -- there is no expectation of privacy.<br/><br/>It is another thing for a person to trail you around recording your every move every day -- that is stalking.<br/><br/>It is one thing for a person to see the address (meta data) on the outside of a envelope of a single piece of mail -- there is no expectation of privacy.<br/><br/>It is another thing for a person to be recording and saving the addresses on every single piece of mail we send and receive -- that is stalking.<br/><br/>Somehow judges do not see to understand that the public wants things that are legal when done incidentally made illegal when it becomes someone's or some agency's paranoid obsession.
LT says, "So we want our spy agencies to spy but get all upset when we find out that they're doing it."<br/><br/>You want our soldiers to kill, but would you not be upset if they killed innocent Americans and innocent foreigners?<br/><br/>It is the same thing.
It didn't have anything on me, so no <a href="http://pipl.com" title="pipl.com" target="_blank">pipl.com</a> has less on us than the NSA.<br/><br/>More to the point, <a href="http://pipl.com" title="pipl.com" target="_blank">pipl.com</a> is not going to subject me to a signature drone strike or put me on a no-fly list.
Yes, unless you live under a rock and have no friends you have only yourself to blame for the NSA knowing stuff about you.<br/><br/>"Everything on your iphone is known by apple. Everything on your Facebook is known by Facebook. Everything on Gmail is known by Google."<br/><br/>But Apple, Google and Facebook haven't killed anyone with signature drone strikes driven by metadata.<br/><br/>You might be horrified at the thought of getting advertising on products you are interested in, but I like it.<br/><br/>But when I said I liked it I did not mean, "Share it with the NSA and foreign intelligence agencies."
To those who say, "if you have nothing to hide you have nothing to fear" please post the itinerary for your 5 year-old daughter next week.<br/><br/>Give your husband a list of everything you've said about him to your best friend.<br/><br/>Give your employer the browsing history of your 16 year-old son or daughter.<br/><br/>Yes, only those without a life have nothing to hide.<br/><br/>The rest of us have plenty of things that spies can use to blackmail us.
The big risk I see is that the NSA will gather information on current and future political, business, academic, scientific, religious and journalistic leaders.  These people do not lead dull boring lives.<br/><br/>If it is true that all of NSAs work has a foreign intelligence purpose and is "centered on counterterrorism, counterproliferation and cybersecurity" why are so many people in Congress acting like they're so fearful of the NSA, acting so deferential as if the NSA has something on them?
Note the code names, Bullrun and Edgewater, are names of US and UK civil war battles.<br/><br/>I think that is pretty much an admission that these spy agencies are targeting their fellow citizens and the political, business and academic leaders of their fellow citizens.<br/><br/>I feel we are going to see the Putinization of America, where the main business and political leaders are increasingly ex-CIA and ex-NSA.
Including gun ownership, meaning the NSA has created something that could easily be converted into a detailed gun registry on US citizens and US residents.  The admit interrogating it for words like pressure cookers and email addresses, they could just as easily interrogate on names of guns, titles of books, anything.
Consider the gun registry and gun control aspects of NSA surveillance.<br/><br/>Many Americans have trouble going from the theory of surveillance to how NSA surveillance affects them.  If they did nothing wrong, what do they have to worry about?<br/><br/>So give them the practical example of guns, gun registration, and gun control.  <br/><br/>That is something many understand and care about.<br/><br/>A national gun database is the natural sub-product of the data gathered by NSA surveillance.  The NSA can search on gun model numbers and keywords like shooting and hunting just as easily as any other words.<br/><br/>The NSA data creates a fairly accurate and complete searchable "national registry of everything", including gun ownership, gun location and gun use.<br/><br/>If you don't mention your guns online, your friends may, and that is enough.<br/><br/>The government does not need a special gun registry, the NSA is creating a registry of everything.<br/><br/>Books, movies, hobbies, guns, technologically the NSA can interrogate their database on anything.
The meaning of words with multiple definitions comes from context.  That is how it works in the English language.<br/><br/>When you connect the words "target" and "no" in answering a question that asks whether the agency listened to the phone calls or read the e-mails and text messages of American citizens with the word target you are implicitly using a definition of target that means sender or receiver of emails.<br/><br/>Sure, in some other context target might mean something else, like concentric red rings on a white background, but that was not the context in which the answer was given.<br/><br/>The NSA just keeps lying.
I think a lot of Americans are having trouble going from the theory of surveillance into what it means for them in their lives.  Why should they worry?  How does it affect them?<br/><br/>Give them the practical example of guns and how the NSA is able to deduce who owns guns, how many guns, how they are stored, when and where they are generally used, using cellphone metadata, using email messages, using Facebook shares, and so on.  If you don't mention them, your friends may, and that is enough.<br/><br/>The government does not need a voluntary or compulsory gun registry.<br/><br/>A national gun registry is the natural outcome of the data gathered by NSA surveillance.  That data creates, or could create at a moment's notice, a fairly accurate and complete searchable national gun registry for the federal government to find who owns what guns and where they keep them.<br/><br/>The NSA surveillance makes possible registries of a lot more too, religious and political beliefs, occupations, friends, business relationships, sleeping habits, hobbies, extra-marital affairs, donations, scams, gambling habits, drinking habits, jokes, movies seen, books read -- you name it, anything you talk about on the phone or on the web, or anything people say about you on the phone or on the web, it is all out there for global collection.<br/><br/>It also makes possible stealing secrets from one business to give to another.<br/><br/>But the gun registry aspect is all that many people will care about.
So you are with me in supporting Snowden as a hero and patriot?<br/><br/>If you support the NSA you support and endorse "the inexorable march of government into every avenue of citizen affairs and private life."
You left out subsidizing banks, the GOP was eager to bail out Wall St.<br/><br/>The law enforcement and justice industry's immense cash cow, "The War on Drugs", the GOP likes that too.<br/><br/>Basically any group with the money to buy their votes through campaign contributions.
The rules need to be changed and a time limit placed on filibusters so that they can delay but not prevent majority rule.<br/><br/>Perhaps a 30 day delay for any filibustered legislation, after which majority rule would apply.<br/><br/>And if Democrats are unable to get the rule change passed, they should do to Republicans what Republicans did to Democrats.  Yes, in the short run this may seem childish, but in the long run it is the necessary adult thing to do, because the current rules are destroying the USA's position in the world.
India, Ecuador, Venezuela and so on need to be aware that there is the US government, a bunch of people who come and go, and then there are the American people who aren't going anywhere.<br/><br/>Snowden is the USA's Tienanmen Square Tank Guy.  He broke the law but he is our hero.<br/><br/>He defied the bureaucracy to defend his nation's constitution and its people.<br/><br/>Siding against Snowden is like siding against Mandela -- diplomatically good in the short run because it gets you favor with the current government -- diplomatically bad in the long run because it angers the nation's people.
That was true of real slavery too.  But it was resolved in the end.<br/><br/>The middle class needs this and any elected official who opposes it is engaged in a war on the middle class.
I hope so.  You'd let someone into your house not knowing who he is?
E-Verify sounds like an excellent idea.  <br/><br/>Sure, employers who use illegal immigrants are going to complain about, obviously.  It means the end of the cheap slave labour they're addicted to.  But so what?  That level of greed is a vice not a virtue.<br/><br/>The important thing will be to ensure that paper work errors can be quickly fixed.  That should be easy enough to do with birth certificates, naturalization certificates and income tax records.
Exactly, this system can only survey ordinary people who are not expecting it.<br/><br/>It won't be effective against organized enemies of the USA.
The terrorists and enemy spies know they're subject to surveillance and take steps to prevent interception.<br/><br/>Which is why at least one of the cases the General he cracked with Prism was actually cracked by Scotland Yard using good old fashion conventional policing tactics (see Guardian.co.uk story).<br/><br/>So the surveillance is after people not hiding what they are doing, which would be ordinary US and allied foreign citizens.<br/><br/>This isn't about terrorists.  This is about the US Constitution and the 4th amendment.
You say you have nothing to hide?<br/><br/>And yet we have records from 10 years ago, back in 2013, that you regularly posted on the dissident website nytimes.com.<br/><br/>Also you sent text messages to people who frequently visited the insurgent website wired.com.<br/><br/>There is also the matter of the car you drive, that un-American Honda.  Your fourth un-American automobile.<br/><br/>Plus didn't you make a trip to Paris in 2015?  You stayed at the same hotel as EU government agents [employees].<br/><br/>It looks to me like you have a great deal to hide.
European commission's vice-president, Viviane Reding is asking US Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. these seven questions.<br/><br/>The answers to these questions will determine whether EU businesses will be able to store customer data on US-based systems.<br/><br/>1. Are Prism and other similar programmes aimed only at the data of US citizens and residents, or also  even primarily  at non-US nationals, including EU citizens?<br/><br/>2. Is access to, collection of or processing of data on the basis of Prism and other programmes  limited to specific and individual cases, and if so what criteria are applied?<br/><br/>3. Is the data of individuals accessed, collected or processed in bulk (or on a very wide scale, without justification relating to specific individual cases) either regularly or occasionally?<br/><br/>4. Is the scope of these programmes restricted to national security or foreign intelligence or is it broader?<br/><br/>5. What avenues, judicial or administrative, are available to companies in the US or the EU to challenge access to, collection of and processing of data under Prism or other programmes?<br/><br/>6.  What avenues are available to EU citizens to be told if they are affected by Prism or other similar programmes and how do they compare with those available to US citizens?<br/><br/>7. What avenues are available to EU citizens or companies to challenge access to, collection of and processing of their personal data under Prism and similar programmes, and how does that compare with the rights of US citizens?
So what is a good replacement for gmail and google, yahoo, hotmail, iCloud and Facebook for those of us who don't live in the USA and whose human rights are not covered by the US Constitution?<br/><br/>Universal NSA surveillance of us doesn't require a search warrant, not even when message contents are examined.<br/><br/>Obviously this continuing situation, which shows no signs of change, means that US companies are unsuitable web service providers for residents and citizens of the USA's NORAD and NATO partners.
Unfortunately the founding fathers did not include back people among humans with inalienable rights.<br/><br/>That was later fixed.<br/><br/>They didn't consider foreigners in foreign lands human either.  <br/><br/>Probably the founding fathers never conceived that any government could have the power to violate the human rights of 95% of humanity.<br/><br/>Rightly, foreigners don't get the right to vote or to immigrate to the USA.  <br/><br/>But we do have basic human rights because we are just as human as US citizens.  <br/><br/>A right you grant yourselves that you do not grant us is a right you do not regard as a human right.
Liberal way?  <br/><br/>Lying is neither a left-wing nor a right-wing trait.  Politicians from the ultra left-wing communist states lie.  Dictators from ultra right-wing dictatorships lie.  Middle of the road politicians lie too.<br/><br/>Lying is not on the left- right-wing axis.  Lying is on the honest-deceitful axis.  
How is this not a overt recipe for BLACKMAIL???  Seems one has NO right to privacy on any form of electronic media in this Land of the FREE????
The U.S. is "special" those Brazilians should just recognize how exceptional we are and be thankful that we are here to "protect" them. Ha!
Take it from a Professor.  Universities are business's - period.  When you recruit a super smart/motivated kid to your school; you are placing a long term BET that said kid will become a physician, captain of industry or Senator.  Schools figured out a long time ago that one super rich alumnus is worth a thousand regular folks. Welcome to the New "U"!  
The Temple Mount is the holiest place on earth. It should be open to all people without constraint.  The Palestinians have a lot of nerve preventing Christians and Jews from peacefully worshiping on this Holy site. If they want peace- they need to grow up.
If the ONLY reason you have for going to college is "what am I going to make" please do me a favor (Research I Prof. for 35 years)  don't go.
Well said- I agree with you 100%. However you seem to be quite naive about the military industrial complex who runs our country. They must be royally PO'd with Puti- suing for PEACE. OMG!
The commercial prison business is not going to like this. Heck- its good business to incarcerate a 19 year old for a few years for smoking the killer weed!
I am a Professor with 35 years of tenure. Bottom line - MOOC's are TRAINING- they have nothing to do with EDUCATION----- period.
Throughout the Middle East- might makes right.  Just ask Israel. They learned that their neighbors have no desire to talk- a sign of weakness.  Kill a few thousand and peace reigns.  Pretty sad huh?
Not a good idea Tamar.  DDT is cheap and effective- HOWEVER- it is one of the most persistent - biomagnifying organic chemicals ever invented. It may kill the mosquito's today- but it will kill you tomorrow.
I go to the deep Amazon annually.  I take Lariam. Some say it gives you weird dreams- I usually get an upset stomach. BUT- I never got malaria even when eaten by the anaphales mosquito.  Unless CDC can assure me that another drug will prevent this horrific disease- I will stick with Lariam.
OK so where does this end?  Universal guilt by association? Seems that our civil liberties are a thing of the past--------the road to the end of our nation. Nero fiddles while Rome burns?
Jeff Bezos-------the world is your cherry to pick!  You are a genius!
U.S. Toxic Imperialism.  Free Trade-Globalization means send our toxic garbage to third world countries and let them deal with the health and ecological consequences.  Unethical and immoral- period.
According the the World Health Organization the total number of deaths attributable to illegal drug overdose is approximately 59,000 per year.  Deaths from acute pesticide exposure exceeds  220,000 per year with an additional 6 million+ hospitalizations.  We must do a better job in regulating pesticides and monitoring the food supply.
And- let us hope they are not on the Sotheby's auction block after having being looted several years from now.
Clearly the one way trip to Mars is a better idea.  Its cheap and you already know the outcome!  I registered!
Most obviously a fossilized Velociraptor Dino Egg!!!!!!
Physicians and scientists are not "recruited."  Individuals must be brilliant, highly motivated and willing to be an indentured servant for more than a decade to qualify for such careers. No one is preventing anyone from any race or economic class from making the commitment.  Affirmative action can only go so far.
Umm? This is illegal based on all international law- so we are bragging about their nefarious, unethical and depraved prowess??
Bravo Doc. Could not have said it better myself.
Essay's, SAT's, AP extra grade point classes---- all meaningless. I have taught over 25,000 undergraduate students over the past 35 years. Give me a no holds barred 15 min. interview with a prospective student, and I will tell you with great confidence whether or not this student will be a successful leader. All the rest of it is a ruse.
Oh Please- they are cutting the price of the HPV vaccine because they can't sell enough of it here. The stockpiles are probably clogging up the warehouse. Follow the dollar folks!
Ahhh- the good ole days!  Each nations team should fight to the death- the winning team gets to pillage and plunder the losers country. Far more simple and less costly than thermonuclear war.
Seems that many of the comments support the idea that "serious archaeologists" have legitimately obtained and studies antiquities and turned them over to the great museums- Ummmm Hello-  those artifacts came from FOREIGN countries- i.e. the patrimony of that country- right??  Ex Post Facto- ALL ANTIQUITIES ARE EITHER LOOTED OR STOLEN.  Should we close down the Met because it houses thousands of Egyptian mummies, sarcophagi and sculptures???
