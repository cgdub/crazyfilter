The Republicans are "downright giddy"? Their actions prompted "cheers and chants" among them? They sport "beaming grins"?<br/>Shameful. Tragic.<br/>This has nothing to do with what is best for Americans. It has everything to do with the Republicans' sustained attack on the elderly, the poor, the middle-class, and the President.
To leave messages with children, spouses, and on answering machines as Mr. Copeland and Mr. Hjort do after being rejected is wrong, wrong, wrong. Conscience cannot be forced. Having been married to a Vietnam veteran for many years and then divorced, I can assure you that these households live with issues stemming from Vietnam and no one needs to add to them. It is a personal choice of the veteran whether or not he wants to make contact. That Mr. Copeland did is his business and the price he is paying is his to endure. There is obviously much behind his story. How can he presume to know what's best for another family?
Still another article detailing another attempt to define this complex educational issue and solve it with a simplistic fix. We began to lose this war when the business of education was taken out of the hands of educators and politicized. Class size matters ... and teacher quality matters ... and administration matters ... and district population matters ... and socioeconomic makeup matters ... and geographical location matters ... and a host of other issues individual to a school district matter. There is no one fix. There never will be. And until politicians get out of our schools and allow professional educators to do their jobs we are not going to solve the problems dealing with educating our children in the 21st century.
I agree with Ms. Haas and Ms. Maisch: Shame on all of them. If 90% of the citizens in this country want a change in the gun laws, then 90% should be voting these spineless, ineffective so-called "representatives" of ours out of office.

Furlough the Republican Congress. They don't want to work toward a solution? They shouldn't work at all. <br/><br/>See what it's like to lose your jobs rather than playing politics with the livelihood of others. Sickening.
Correct, jwm; Bob from Ohio, there are many in Texas who are not of this ilk and who worked hard for area dems and the President. We fight on to make Texas blue.
How did he get elected? He's from Texas, that's how. (Check out another Texas newcomer who is equally intransigent, arrogant, etc., DR. Donna Campbell.) With any luck, Cruz will go the way of the Siberian meteorite: Make a big boom, flash a big light, do some damage, and leave a big mess -- but quickly. A mess no one wants to have to clean up, but everybody is relieved is over.
I was tested for celiac and do not have it but consider myself gluten-sensitive. That said, I am taking a common sense approach to my diet. I avoid wheat, processed foods, and fast food and I do feel much better. My diet, when consisting of fruits, vegetables, fish, chicken, and occasionally beef, prepared simply, is quite easy to follow and doesn't have to be boring. Yes, I occasionally fall off the wagon, crave a piece of bread or pasta, and I pay for it by not feeling well for a while.<br/>
Time to throw yourself on the sword, Mr. Boehner. You're on borrowed time, anyway because we the people are going to throw all of those bums out in due time.
Thank you for creating a series that doesn't focus on sex, every week, every plot. Not to sound like a prude (I'm not), but I'm glad my kids are grown and I don't have to explain to them that TV sitcoms today aren't a reflection of life because people don't spend every waking moment of their day embroiled in a (hilarious?) sexual situation. TV use was always monitored and limited on weeknights; today I'd be tempted just to turn it off. Hey, that's pretty much what I've come to do anyway.
I don't imagine I'll hear anything new or inspiring from either candidate. And when all the dust settles and political commentators have finished their tedious and ultimately worthless "analyzing," both sides will claim victory. Blah blah blah.
Another Repub who didn't "divulge his plans" ... Scott Walker. Yes, we should be VERY wary of politicians who don't divulge plans.
Paul Ryan popping up from a gopher hole ... that one's gonna carry me through the day!
We are not in the eighteenth century: either we hold to a self righteousness and 'racist' agenda that demonizes the opposition or we open with a more sophisticated approach that sees and speaks to the complexity.<br/>
Evidence of the richness of the Obama approach is seen in the convention: in the Republican, primarily white speaking of their deep values in one 'God' which is theirs (Israel-Christian right) and in the Democratic, a rich diversity speaking to the poor and outcast, to the complexity.<br/>
God guide America, God bless the world.
Just reflects many American's ignorance of those different from themselves. Either you engage with respectfully or you retreat to a smaller view which is in danger of distortion. The 'other' bears all the projections. There is no 'righteous' nation nor group. We are all in this together.
The word becomes constructed and hence without potency and priority.
How can one look at the photo attached to this article and not say that part of the solution is a redistribution of wealth? It is complex but when you have a guy like B. not looking at his own excess (and in his case depravity) as part of the problem then will we ever get anywhere?
Tell me a story about a great person who was not a success. This is such an 'easy' story. Will we ever break out of the box? 'A Good Pakistani'. We are so America-centric. Find me a story of 'A Good Pakistani' outside of 'my world'. Crazy.
Capitalism evolves and has a life cycle. We are seeing the separations of rich and poor and the accepted norm of deception that becomes necessary in both tight competition and in preserving the status quo as it grows.<br/>
With this comes a necessity for growth and in particular new markets. I do not see most countries imperialistically expanding as the US. Putin's comment is extreme yet contains some truth in labeling us as 'parasites'. We are the best of countries and the worst in that our exports in the form of media and non-necessary goods that come in creating demand are excessive and disrupt cultures dividing them in two. We never admit this truth but demonize those who are against the 'expansion'. In a world where GNP and Purchasing Power put one country over another again we are shortsighted. Having lived in the third world (be it Iran or Africa), I have come to know that THEY have the solution. Instead, we litter the airwaves that place us over them in position of 'pity' and 'paternalism' and so miss the other side.<br/>
America's and many Christians support of 'Israel' as a nation on one level is important, yet if we are simply aligning privilege and blindness with privilege and blindness then we contribute to the terrible tone of injustice that rings in our ears and makes our steps heavy.
At the grocery store, the lines are long at night at the self-check station. Some employees are stretched, others are scratching themselves and walking in circles in the opposite direction.
<br/><br/>If and when the government slashes spending, jobs will be lost and there will be more standing in the self checkout line or others stretched or scratching themselves. One problem: there is little incentive or reward for good performance. Others: legal issues prevent. Another problem: there are many other problems among tending to or going in the opposite direction scratching. I see great people everywhere so I do not worry.
I have lived in Africa as an American for a total of four years out of my last fifteen years. I tire of the West's sole focus on the African tragedy depicted in the starving and the war torn. While this scope is part of the truth, this tragedy is trumped by the aliveness and faithful found in the African people.<br/>
If only we could control the world with drones!
We are a stupid and out of control people.
<br/><br/>From Chuang Tzu speaking of Confucious: "The Yellow Emperor learns something about the nature of kingship from a boy tending to some horses: Governing the empire I suppose is not much different from herding horses. Get rid of whatever is harmful to the horsesthats all.
We make the assumption that achievement and being pulled into the global market is a movement to greater human flourishing. Maybe we could learn from some countrie's self-sufficient decentralized villages. In approaching them for 'their knowledge', they are empowered and a greater relationship could be built. I tire of pundits running away with words which in all honesty falls so short in capturing the complexity and uniqueness of every situation.
part of the path to peace is not the content of what we say but how we say it.
Of course there is a difference between Israel the state and Israel as 'hope'. When I hear the word 'Israel' it is an Israel that embraces the outcast as in Ishmael and Esau. Jesus points to God and was sacrificed between two others. On one level, we should support the state Israel, encourage it to use its advantage and strength wisely (parallel to US). In another, we should encourage what 'Israel' has stood for 'spiritually', a people always fluid and concerned for justice and the outcast.
This is a country where the majority do not have the wisdom to understand ways to peace that are sustained and important.
Obama is going to run rings around a GOP-dominated House. The GOP have no plan except to bring Obama down. But as they showed in their open debate with him last year when they let the cameras into their sparring with Obama, they are no match for him. Now that Obama has a GOP House to fight with, they'll suffer by comparison. He's going to look like the great conciliator, and they'll look like the great obstructionists.<br /><br />Watch the GOP misstep time and again in 2011. Obama is a shoe-in for a second term. One wishes that his inevitable re-election opens a challenge from the left, to maybe scare him out of his Blue Dog propensities into being a real progressive, which is what the country needs and hasn't had since ... well, since Eisenhower.
Unfortunately, there can be no meeting ground in our current politics. The two opposing sides are now so distant from each other, each believe the other is evil. Yes, evil. Many liberals think Bush did evil things -- war with Iraq, lying, torture. Many conservatives think Obama is evil: a socialist whose tyrannical government is taking away their liberties. That's where we stand -- in Manichean opposition.<br /><br />Meanwhile, our real problems -- education, unemployment (22% if counted correctly), loss of manufacturing capability, crumbling infrastructure, planet-damaging energy use, personal and national debt -- all remain unsolved. Our political system is inadequate to our challenges. As bad as things are, they will have to get a whole lot worse before we come to our senses.<br /><br />Our leaders -- our elite -- are so removed by privilege from the lives of regular Americans, they have no idea what is going on, and hence, no real empathy for what the average American has to contend with. They can neither see nor feel outside their bubble.<br /><br />These two polarities -- between our two parties (Dems and Reps) and between our two classes (the top 1% elite who runs things and average Americans) -- are at present utterly unbridgeable. If an amazingly bright and seemingly sensible and willing-to-compromise fellow like President Obama can't make much of a difference, who can? Who will?<br /><br />We will only change when we start hitting rock-bottom, and we still have half the way to go. It will take another decade for us to get there. Meanwhile, fasten your seatbelts: it's going to be a mighty rocky ride.
The sad, sad thing is that Obama has not only let himself and his party down: he has let his country down.<br /><br />He is setting himself up for losing in 2012. Our economy will not have recovered by then -- and the GOP will blame Obama, and his feckless record will quite properly count against him. Then the GOP will take over completely, and we'll be in for another Bush/Cheney-like disaster.<br /><br />I cannot believe that it took Obama, evidently a smart man, only two years to throw away a winning hand -- to the point that he is now capitulating to the Republicans on such a clear-cut issue.<br /><br />I don't blame the Democratic Party for this mess. Nancy Pelosi has led a perfectly progressive House, and the Senate Dems have had the filibuster against them.<br /><br />I blame Obama. His playing-to-the-middle instead of to his progressive base has doomed his Presidency. He has stabbed his base in the heart. The progressives who worked to make him President will not work for him again. The disappointment is too deep; all hope for real change from him is now dead. With this last capitulation, Obama has shoveled the final soil onto his own coffin.<br /><br />Let's face it: his messaging has been terrible because he never had a governing message. He has simply engineered a series of hapless ad-hoc compromises with his enemies, and bleated out hapless ad-hoc excuses for his compromises.<br /><br />Very sad for him, for his party, and for us.<br /><br />Let's hope that some day a real progressive will lead the Democratic Party and make some real changes. And let's hope we never again make the mistake of voting for a fake progressive.
GOP obstructionism works. It helped keep America screwed-up these last two years, so the GOP could blame the Dems for everything wrong, and get the votes they needed to take over the House.<br /><br />It will work again for them in the next two years. With their House majority, the GOP can now make damn sure nothing good will happen for our country, and then they can blame Obama for everything wrong, and replace him with Mitt Romney (or even Sarah Palin).<br /><br />The worse they make things for everyone else, the better for them. What a terrible irony.
Campaigner Obama put himself forward as a progressive new-comer, but as President turned out to be an old-style backroom deal-making politician, with no core of his own. It was all a sham. He's a pragmatist all right, which means he stands for nothing. There's a fine line between having no principles and being unprincipled, and Obama skirts it.<br /><br />We have to look elsewhere for a truly change-agent president -- Howard Dean, Alan Grayson, Russ Feingold. The soul of the Democratic Party -- the progressive left -- has to take over the Democratic Party, just as the Tea Party is taking over the GOP. The time has come for class warfare against the plutocracy that is disgracing our democracy.
Without the government, we wouldn't have had the internet.<br /><br />And currently, with employer-based and for-profit healthcare, American private enterprise is made less competitive versus other nations.<br /><br />Without government funding of green energy, we'll never get the private-enterprise green energy businesses we need. China outcompetes us because its government subsidizes those businesses that need to be subsidized, like green energy.<br /><br />We subsidize the oil business and agribusiness to our detriment. The whole GOP Conservative anti-nanny state tradition is simply code for "hey, we rich people don't want our taxes spent on poor people." Meanwhile, we have corporate welfare like there's no tomorrow. The conservatives would be intellectual honest if they stopped giving out corporate welfare and stopped complaining about regular folks being helped by government. They want our taxes spent on helping rich people instead of poor and middle-class folks. That's what the mean when they bang on about "personal responsibility."<br /><br />We're beyond being a nanny state anyway. 38% of our GDP comes from federal and state enterprise. That train left the station years ago. Now the problem is: should our taxes be used to stimulate job-creating businesses and retirement security -- or Wall Street gambling?<br /><br />The conservative tradition stands for income inequality and nothing else.
I once taught for two weeks in the Bronx, to 14-year-olds. One of my two classes was so unruly they were unteachable. Granted I was a novice, but at one point I stood with a master teacher in a sea of chaos, and she whispered to me, "sometimes you just have to wait for them to come to their senses." I thought to myself, you're my role model?<br /><br />The kids would only "come to their senses" if I called on the help of a cop, who could cower them to silence. The few times I did manage to engage with these kids, it was obvious that they were bright and talented, but that there was nobody who cared for them. The five students out of a class of 32 who were attentive and did the work, had to struggle against constant noise and indifference.<br /><br />Yes, it will require heroic efforts to save black youth. But more than that, it will require heroic amounts of money, and this will never be forthcoming, We will continue to warehouse these kids through school and send them out into the world ill-prepared for anything but the acting out of their personal traumas.<br /><br />We'd rather spend our money going overseas to kill foreign Muslims than spend it on saving Americans at home.<br /><br />That's the way it is, and that's the way it will be. After all, poor folks don't vote, only middle-class people do.
They say a rising tide lifts all yachts. Maybe the rising voices of the people will sink them.
The changes that Tom Friedman mentions aren't going to happen. Nor will the most necessary change of all -- a massive public works program that could employ millions to build and repair our infrastructure (smart grid, high-speed rail, broadband, big tax breaks to green-energy start-ups and folks who green-energize their homes, etc),<br /><br />The corporate stranglehold over the nation's future will continue -- the fat cats of Wall Street, Big Oil, Big Agribusiness, Big Pharma, Big-Bonus-and-Golden-Parachute CEOs, the Big Military Industrial Complex. We on Main Street will remain the willing Stockholm Syndrome dupes of the Washington-Wall Street-Pentagon Axis of Predatory Fraudsters.<br /><br />Let's face it, this is what America is. This is what America has become. This is what America will be. There will be no Poor People's Movement. No Pitchfork Uprising. No massive Middle-Class March. No national demand for the reining in of our plutocrats. No nationwide insistence on holding them accountable for ripping us off, legally and illegally. The revolution will not be televised because the revolution will never happen, One cannot get a nation of obese potatoes off the couch and into the streets. They're happier vegetating on their behinds in front of the TV machine's 24/7 propaganda.<br /><br />It doesn't matter which political party is in power: the fleecing of regular folk by our morally blind elites will continue. Our elites enter into their bubble at our Ivy League universities, and they never exit this bubble. They don't have to. Life is good in their bubble. Outside the bubble, Main Street dreams turn into Pain Street ashes.<br /><br />The Tea Party folks -- our latest populist movement -- are complaining about big spending. They are right to do so. But here's the weird thing. While they may vent about the big spending on social services (healthcare, Medicare, and Social Security, which is solvent, BTW), there's not a single peep out of them about our Godzilla-sized military spending.<br /><br />America is looking more and more like Rome under Nero. And what do the Tea Party people do about this trend? While we're burning and our elites are fiddling, they're complaining about the quality of the firewood.<br /><br />The decline of America will only be arrested if the greed of our elites consumes all reason, and renders our entire middle class totally desperate or jobless. Will our elites be that dumb? Possibly. Meanwhile, see you at the next financial meltdown. And get used to it -- meltdowns have been, and will continue to be, our traditional way of life.<br />
Despite our President wanting to build a smart grid, and despite a growing number of Americans being aware of the ultimate cost of climate change, we in America are going to be watching Europe and China beat us in the green energy game. Our political system is too dysfunctional, and too beholden to Big Oil.<br /><br />Four out of the five biggest companies by revenue in the world are oil companies, and three of them are American. Until we find a way to make it worthwhile for those oil companies to incorporate green energy in their energy mix, we can forget about catching up with other countries who are already well ahead of us.<br /><br />We seem to prefer to spend our taxes on our military and on corporate welfare and on Wall Street -- the very same entities who are responsible for our decline. And we neglect our infrastructure and public school system.<br /><br />Maybe regular Americans have become natural and docile victims of our elite, suffering from Stockholm Syndrome. Either that, or we are so uninformed as to be the dumbest nation on earth. I don't know which is worse. I hope there is another explanation, as well as a workable solution. Maybe the smart readers of the New York Times have explanations and solutions at hand.
Kemo:<br />Yes, great does depend on definition. Let's start with the Beatles and Bob Dylan. Then we might diverge. I think Captain Beefheart and Van Morrison and Frank Zappa are greats, but they haven't sold as many records as AC/DC or Garth Brooks, whom I don't think are great, but millions would say are great. The Arcade Fire people have not released enough records to quality for greatness, even if they are, which I don't see them attaining. They seem to me a more simple-minded Radiohead. If you compare them to the art rock of the 70s, whom they compare themselves to, they don't at this moment hold a candle to Roxy Music or Genesis or Yes or Emerson Lake and Palmer. They go for the same bombast, but one misses the ingenuity of the original art rock bands. But that is just my opinion, and I may be proved wrong. Let's hope. I don't see much in contemporary rock that's all that interesting. At least Lady Gaga has come up with four excellent songs so far, which is more than Madonna had after two albums, and Madonna doesn't even write her own melodies like Gaga does. There's a reason there are so many versions by amateurs of Lady Gaga songs on YouTube: they're unbelievably catchy -- a catchy hook is the first job of any good songwriter. That's why Lennon/McCartney are up there with Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, the Gershwins, etc -- they wrote more catchy hooks than anyone else.
Kemo:<br />I love Aracade Fire, too, though they're certainly not among the greats. What we have here is a difference of taste,not of intellect. You acquired your taste for Arcade Fire via the media too. Their PR machine is aimed at intellectual snobs and hipsters, while Lady Gaga's machine is aimed at disaffected club youth. There's room for both in my eclectic universe, and not in yours.So be it. But you don't have to get all snooty about it, dude (or dudette).
Lady Gaga is the lady of the moment, and will continue to be so. She's wicked smart the way she constructed her persona, in the same way that Bowie constructed his, and MJ did, and Madonna did. Every time someone makes fun of her or writes her off, they create more fans for her. Plus, she writes her own melodies, which Madonna never had the talent to do. Lady Gaga is going to be around for a long, long time, because she's an an excellent songwriter, a cultural force, and a really smart cookie. Get used to it.
It is a great pity that many on America's Religious Right have forgotten the infinite demand that love makes, and have exchanged it for the rather limitless demands that hate can also make. Their homophobia is a case in point. One would hope that sooner rather than later, this will change -- perhaps when the Pat Robertsons have gone, and the hate fades, and is replaced by love again.
When Obama plays for the middle of the middle that he likes so much, he is not aiming for the center, but for the right. The GOP has moved us over so far to the right, nobody knows where the center is anymore.<br /><br />It is a sign of the times that Obama has a Trojan Horse going called the Deficit Commission. Is he really going to start attacking Social Security now? Something that Bush Two tried to do and miserably flopped at? I never thought I'd live to see the day that a Democratic president would fall so hard for a GOP canard of cutting the deficit on the backs of the poor -- instead of pushing really hard for raising the top marginal rate from its paltry 35% (it was over 90% under Eisenhower) to 50% plus, or for Tobin-taxing Wall Street, or for making sure that tax loopholes do not allow giant corporations like Goldman Sachs to get away with paying a tax rate of 1% like they did in 2007.<br /><br />Are we all so bamboozled that even Democrats fall for this "attacking entitlements" nonsense? If we are, we may never get out of the Great American Ditch dug for us by Reagan, Bush Two, Bill Clinton (who signed the repeal of Glass-Steagall that let "too big to fail" Citigroup exist, and signed a bill that freed derivatives trading from all constraints), Bush-Cheney (when government folks in charge of overseeing permits to Big Oil had sex-and-coke parties with them), and Obama (who gave passes to financial terrorists like Goldman Sachs and environmental terrorists like BP).<br /><br />Here's the salient fact to bear in mind: our Ivy League elites have rolled back FDR's revolution to the point that today, the bottom 80% of Americans have to make do with 15% of the incredibly shrinking American pie.<br /><br />Obama, wake up! You've got Stockholm Syndrome! Start recognizing your enemies! Come back to your friends!
The GOP have driven us into a ditch so deep there is no getting out. Even if Obama the President started acting like Obama the Candidate, we would not get out.<br /><br />The deregulation-and-tax-cuts-for-the-rich ditch was first dug by Ronald Reagan. The first meltdown since the Great Depression was the S &amp; L crisis that started on his watch. Before Reagan the top marginal tax rate was 60% under Carter, having come down from over 90% under Eisenhower. In those days you could work for General Motors all your life, afford a home and retire with dignity, on one salary.<br /><br />Reagan cut that rate down to 28% in 1981. Bush One continued Reagan's voodoo economics, and Bill Clinton, despite a budget surplus, continued the ditch-digging by signing two bills that (a) repealed Glass-Steagall (and allowed "too big to fail" Citigroup to exist), and (b) freed derivatives trading of all constraints. Under Bush-Cheney the gloves came off completely, and the folks in charge of overseeing permits for Big Oil had sex-and-coke parties with them. Under Obama our financial terrorists like Goldman Sachs and our environmental terrorists like BP still have a free hand.<br /><br />Today the top marginal tax rate is 35% and the bottom 80% of Americans have to make do with 15% of the incredibly shrinking American pie.<br /><br />Our entitled Ivy League elites have sunk us all. We will NEVER get out of this ditch, because by now enough of us -- independents, Fox News viewers, Tea Party people, Blue Dogs, the MSM, Congress, the New York Times -- have a permanent case of Stockholm Syndrome. Our fourth estate acts as the 24/7 enablers of this syndrome.<br /><br />It took our elites just three decades to reverse FDR's policies and to dig the Great American Ditch, which has now become the grave of the American Dream.<br /><br />It will be up to our children to dig us out. Here's hoping enough of us teach our kids the basic decency of sharing -- so the next generation can grow up with the moral backbone to reclaim the American Dream.
Spare us, Mr. Brooks. This was a Special Ops guy surrounded by his buddies who was screwing up a mission that was all too easy to screw up.<br /><br />Back when the Pentagon rolled Obama against the wishes of Joe Biden, Obama decided that he'd go for a surge, and get out after 18 months -- a perfect Obaman compromise: we'll surge because that's what you Generals want, and then we'll get out because that's what we need to do politically -- so I, Obama, can get re-elected.<br /><br />Then Obama went round the table and asked them each one, all the generals and the pols and Ambassador and Special Envoy: "You may not agree with what we've decided to do, but will you execute?" And they all said yes.<br /><br />McCrystal didn't execute, plain and simple. This guy who covered up the fragging of Pat Tillman and told the aggrieved family to go jump in the lake, he was already skating on thin ice. Then he screwed up. He all of a sudden didn't think the mission would succeed. Of course we all know it won't, but his job was to execute and see what he could do in 18 months before the drawdown. When he figured this job was too tough to handle, he started behaving like he was the mission, and not Team Obama.<br /><br />Well, Obama is now in whip-cracking mode -- witness BP having to toe the line or else. McCrystal wasn't even given a chance to go clear his desk in Afghanistan. They boxed his stuff and sent it back for him to sort through in the humiliation he so richly deserves.<br /><br />Mr. Brooks, you often have great insight -- bohos and all -- but sometimes your conservative bias leads you to take a wild shot at some cultural shift which may or may not apply. In this case -- the firing of a general who did not execute on a promise he made his boss -- you are firing with blanks.<br /><br />Adam Ash
Supreme Court, have you no shame?<br /><br />McCathyism is back.<br /><br />By this law, any and all environmental activists can end up in jail. Any Muslim in America with family in the Middle East and elsewhere.<br /><br />By this law, when Dr King was in jail, they could have rounded up the entire Civil Rights movement.<br />You think I'm kidding? What's Obama going to do if a GOP Congress starts naming domestic terrorist organizations?<br /><br />Watch out, Planned Parenthood.<br /><br />Adam Ash
The fact that the marriage between Obama and Americans has soured has a lot to do with how the marriage between Obama and reporters has soured -- and especially how there was neither a courtship nor an engagement between Obama and Fox News.<br /><br />For example, it's strange that even the commentariat on the left are not hailing Obama's accomplishment -- to get the fourth biggest corporation in the world to ante up a down payment of $20 billion over the next few years, administered by a 3rd party to compensate their victims quickly -- as one of the most remarkable presidential achievements of modern times. I don't remember anything like that happening with Bhopal and Exxon Valdez. I don't remember Reagan, the Bushes, Carter or Clinton doing anything remotely as effective for us regular folks.<br /><br />What are the chattering classes doing instead? They are banging on about Obama's "disappointing" Oval Office speech, and the fact that he is not playing the Drama Queen-in-Chief in this BP tragedy. Our punditocrats prefer theatrics to real-world performance. The posturing of the 4th estate around this disaster is on the same continuum of tastelessness as Joe Barton's apology to BP. And THAT has a lot to do with how Americans perceive Obama, because they're looking at him through MSM goggles.<br /><br />If one takes off those goggles, admittedly a near-nigh impossible task, one may see him differently. Like I do on the $20 billion issue.<br /><br />Thank you, President Obama. You may have let down progressives on many issues (you are not the change I voted for in 2008), but this was a remarkable achievement. On behalf of all the "small people" I thank you from the bottom of my heart. Your action has made this American heart swell a little bigger.<br /><br />Adam Ash
Obama's big mistake was appointing Geithner and Summers as his economic team. There were others to choose from: Joseph Stiglitz springs to mind. One assumes that was what Obama wanted: to save Wall Street at our expense. His rhetoric against the banksters was not backed by firm action against them.<br /><br />His second big mistake was that, after saying we needed a public option to "keep the insurance industry honest," he did not, when the chips were down, give the impression that he was fighting to keep the public option alive.<br /><br />Keeping Guantanamo open and extraordinary rendition and indefinite detention going, and increasing troop levels in Afghanistan have also been factors to add to progressive disappointment, but I think mollycoddling Wall Street and not fighting tooth and nail for the public option were his big mistakes.<br /><br />Obama will still be a better president than all of the more recent ones from Reagan on (the competition is not formidable), but unless he launches us into a real green energy future, he will not be remembered as a great president. Which will be a pity, because he has it in him to be that.<br /><br />Perhaps the challenges have been too great for a him and his team to rise to. But FDR had bigger challenges, and rose to them (he also had more than two terms). Obama is undoubtedly the best man for the job. And if re-elected, he has many more years to go. For the sake of our much-imperiled nation, one hopes he grows to greatness in the job.<br /><br />Adam Ash

On behalf of all the "small people" I thank you from the bottom of my heart. Your action has made this American heart swell a little bigger.<br /><br />Adam Ash
Obama lost me long before he let Congress craft a healthcare bill that killed the public option. What is he prepared to fight for? His half-baked policies give the impression that he isn't even prepared to fight for his re-election.<br /><br />Obama lost me NOT when he made a deal with Big Pharma to ban importation of cheaper drugs. He lost me NOT when said the public option was not essential to a healthcare bill. He lost me NOT when he said he wanted to find savings in Medicare, which nevertheless scared me.<br /><br />Obama lost me when he said "We shouldn't be tilting at windmills here" about going after the fat cat bankers of Wall Street. Then he worked with the fat cats to craft legislation in June last year that left derivatives largely unregulated and did not rein in the banks on bonuses or leverage -- allowing Wall Street to coin it in 2009 while Main Street is still suffering. We bailed out the banksters, and they used our money to position themselves for huge bonuses. An adder digesting a rodent has more shame about its prey than today's Wall Street has about the rest of us.<br /><br />More than Obama's wobbliness on healthcare, more than his sell-out to Big Pharma, more than his stepping up the war in Afghanistan even, his comity with the fat cat bankers who ruined our economy and threw 100 million people all over the world out of work and into hunger -- that's what sticks in this progressive's throat. Meanwhile, the Fed floods the banksters with cheap money: essentially printing their profits for them.<br /><br />Do us regular folks who suffer because of Wall Street cosmic incompetence get a break? No. Here's a nicely odious but appropriate analogy: a court, faced with the crime of a homicidal maniac, picks out his next victims for him and delivers them to him all trussed up.<br /><br />Wall Street decimated us, and Obama has let them keep the tools with which they did it -- so they can do it again. Yes, caving on healthcare is terrible, but letting the destroyers of millions of livelihoods not only get away with it, but making sure they can do it again -- that is unforgivable.<br /><br />I am hoping for a credible and charismatic champion of the left to take Obama down in the 2012 primary, or at least force him to explain himself and change his triangulating ways.<br /><br />I loved Obama the candidate; I despair in Obama the president.<br /><br />Because if Obama doesn't change, the next Republican President will take us further down the Reagan-Clinton-Bush creek and over the fall onto the rocks of a failed state.
OK, so a product costs $400 in 2013. A new government program begins that will affect the cost of that product. It is predicted that the new product will cost $600 in 2014. <br/><br/>WAIT, the new product will "only" cost $500 in 2014, "LOWER THAN PREDICTED." <br/><br/>What great news! Thanks US government. <br/><br/>I mean really? Are you kidding me? Who cares that the cost is lower than predicted? Does it cost MORE than before the PPACA was passed? <br/><br/>All one has to do is read the CMS reports from 2010 and 2013. "Obamacare" will increase health care costs. (by $621 BILLION over the next ten years) Between 2015-2022 the cost curve bends up!<br/><br/>This is the signature legislation from a president who explained that we need this law, "because the rising cost of healthcare was creating an unsustainable burden on the taxpayer."<br/><br/>It is almost beyond belief. And the NY Times is complicit with this puff piece masquerading as news.
This argument is BEYOND silly. It completely ignores how our government works. The members of congress were elected specifically because they DON'T agree with Obama/Liberal policies like Obamacare. So, Congress should just roll over and give the President what he wants. Absolutely ridiculous.
Except that the President stated that "The rising cost of health care was creating an unsustainable burden on the taxpayer." This country can not afford Medicare in its present form. We are sitting on a demographic time bomb with the baby boomers retiring. <br/><br/>Additionally, I believe the President has set back the cause of single payer by a generation. The democrats passed the ACA on a single party vote. The democrats didn't even have enough support in their own party for a "Public Option!"<br/><br/>The people who keep talking about "Single payer" in the comments section seem to reside in fantasy land!
unfortunately, this debacle of a law, which was sold to the public based on some blatant lies; has set back the cause of single payer for a generation!
The revisionist history is a thing to behold.<br/>|<br/><a href="http://www.davidstuff.com/political/wmdquotes.htm" title="http://www.davidstuff.com/political/wmdquotes.htm" target="_blank">http://www.davidstuff.com/political/wmdquotes.htm</a><br/><br/>Also, let's not forget that Hussein used chemical weapons against his own people as well.
would love to see the data or polls that support the Democrats re-taking the house. This seems like nothing but wishful thinking on "Philster's" part. "Quite possibly?" Based on what?
How silly to blame the republicans. The truth is that the American public does NOT support any type of military action on a BIPARTISAN basis. Congress represents their constituents. The constituents don't want this war. But "J" sees fit to blame the republicans. Is their hypocrisy on the part of republican politicians? No more than their is for the Democratic politicians who were anti war and could have cared less that Saddam Hussein used gas on the Kurds in Iraq.
"Republicans" created the slower recovery! That is rich. after 5 years of the Obama presidency and Trillions in Keynesian stimulus.
RealTruth lives in a fantasy world where the PPACA is BOOSTING EMPLOYMENT! LOL!!!
You call yourself "RealTruth" and yet claim that Obamacare is creating jobs and boosting full time employment? Why not see what (Far right wing ;-) ) Union leader for the Teamsters, James Hoffa says about that?<br/><br/><a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2013/07/12/union-letter-obamacare-will-destroy-the-very-health-and-wellbeing-of-workers/" title="http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2013/07/12/union-letter-obamacare-will-destroy-the-very-health-and-wellbeing-of-workers/" target="_blank">http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2013/07/12/union-letter-obam...</a><br/><br/>"First, the law creates an incentive for employers to keep employees work hours below 30 hours a week. Numerous employers have begun to cut workers hours to avoid this obligation, and many of them are doing so openly. The impact is two-fold: fewer hours means less pay while also losing our current health benefits."<br/><br/>"the ACA will shatter not only our hard-earned health benefits, but destroy the foundation of the 40 hour work week that is the backbone of the American middle class."<br/><br/>BOOSTING EMPLOYMENT? Shame on you!
Short term gains for the wealthy are a byproduct of this policy. Don't you see what is going on here? This is all done for political reasons. This was all about the election in 2012 and going forward in 2014. If the Fed pulled back and people realized just how bad things are. Do you think Obama and the Obama sychophants would be re-elected? WAKE UP!
So true. And the majority of the readers here will support Hillary in 2016. <br/><br/>"In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including al Qaeda members ... It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons."<br/>-- Sen. Hillary Clinton (D, NY), Oct 10, 2002
Yawn... The predictable call for a single payer from the automaton crowd. Unfortunately, the PPACA was so poorly drafted that it did not address the KEY issue of cost control. Within a month of the laws signing the Medicare actuary (in what the NY Times called a "detailed and rigorous analysis of the law) determined that the new law would INCREASE health care costs, not lower them. <br/><br/>Of course prior to the laws passage, the President stated that "the rising cost of health care was creating an unsustainable burden on the taxpayer!"<br/><br/>The constant promised of Obama, Pelosi et al of cost control, job creation and being able to keep your plan; will turn out to be untrue for MILLIONS of Americans. <br/><br/>The Democrats have damaged the cause of single payer for a generation to come!
Because people like you don't bother to look! There are so many great alternatives out there. <br/><br/><a href="http://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/how-to-replace-obamacare" title="http://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/how-to-replace-obamacare" target="_blank">http://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/how-to-replace-obamacare</a>
SPOT ON!<br/><br/>The reason why medicare and Social Security were so popular is that EVERYONE paid in and everyone got a benefit back. This is a system that disrupts the entire system for 10% of the population. There were better ways to do this, but the Democrats would not be stopped. <br/><br/>I urge EVERYONE who cares about this issue and this horrific law to read this piece.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/how-to-replace-obamacare" title="http://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/how-to-replace-obamacare" target="_blank">http://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/how-to-replace-obamacare</a>
What planet do you live on? The democrats owned this law. They passed it without a single republican vote. If single payer was wildly popular within the democratic party; the new law would have been a single payer system! There was not even support within the democratic party for a "public option!"<br/><br/>This governmental debacle that is obamacare will have set back the goal of a single payer system by a generation. After this disaster that will CLEARLY not do as promised; do you believe the public will embrace a government health care system? <br/><br/>SHEESH!
@common Sense:<br/><br/>You are quiet a piece of work! There wasn't even enough support in the Democratic party to pass a public option. <br/><br/>We must pass health care reform that will work and that is a POLITICAL POSSIBILITY. <br/><br/>At this point in our countries history; single payer health care is a pipe dream. As a matter of fact, the DISASTER that is Obamacare has set back the goal of a single payer system by a generation. <br/><br/>What a debacle!
Posts like these make me laugh. There was not even enough support within the Democratic party for a public option and you are talking about "single payer."<br/><br/>By selling this law on a pack of lies; The President and the Democrats have done harm to the cause of single payer. They have set back the cause by a generation.
Unfortunately, with this government run debacle, The democrats have set back the cause of single payer health care for a generation!
This type of post makes me laugh. A law is rolled out that is a MASSIVE governmental program. It clearly will NOT do all the things that it was promised to do! And then again and again people claim.... "Single payer is the way to go."<br/><br/>While I agree with that statement; this particular law will have set back the cause of TRUE single payer/governmental health care by a generation!
Unfortunately, this law was so poorly drafted and passed against the wishes of the majority of americans; that it will probably set back the cause of single payer for a generation!
It is clear that this law was sold to the public on a pack of lies! How refreshing it would have been to have seen an HONEST selling of the law. Americans, covering the uninsured is a moral imperative! Some of you will see cost savings, but others will see their costs INCREASE. But, this is part of the social contract as we attempt to make sure that all americans have access to medical care!<br/><br/>Instead, we were told that the law would lower costs for EVERYONE! We were told that if you like your plan, you can keep it, period! We were told that the law would be great for business. Nancy told us that it would create 4,000,000 jobs, almost 400,000 of those jobs immediately. <br/><br/>This law is so bad and so unpopular that I fear the democrats have set back the cause of a SINGLE PAYER system for at least a generation! <br/><br/>Is there anyone here who really believes that costs will not continue to skyrocket and that it won't cause the long term debt and our deficit to balloon?<br/><br/>Democrats would be better off to distance themselves from this law. There are already so many negative stories that it is going to impact the 2014 midterms. If the Republicans take back the Senate. The party of NO will quickly become the democrats and the President will become President Veto. The democrats will be in a position where all they are doing is "obstructing."<br/><br/>When both private and public sector unions come out with SCATHING letters railing against the law; you know you are in trouble.
Bill, I left the Republican party this year because it has become a "know-nothing" and thoughtless flat-world circle of true believers. Yes, I can see why Joe the Plumber would be appealing to you --- a phoney tripping through life avoiding regulations, avoiding paying his share of taxes, and seeking his 15 minutes of fame by posing as something he isn't. What an American hero!<br /><br />McCain's all-consuming search for the presidency has created a pathetic figure who wants to appear to be all things to all people, but has produced a campaign that resounds through a hollow echo chamber that is full of sound and fury and signifies nothing.
The Republican party has become a haven for reactionaries, the "know-nothings," the flat-world society, the neo-cons, and a steadily declining number of hard-core supporters. Over the last eight years the Republicans have proved to be incapable of governing in a manner that benefits Americans. Today it rants and raves and still cannot focus on the issues before us. Until the party can come to grips with the reality that it is a party of the few for the few, it has lost its right to govern. Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt, and even Ronald Reagan would be ashamed of what the party has become.<br /><br />This, from a former Republican and now avowed independent.
What a novel idea to start talking to your friends and perhaps, even your enemies. Perhaps some administration will come along and recognize that we don't have to bully everyone on the block and that America does have a realistic moral position that does not require us to look down our noses at everyone else. Hmmm. I wonder which would be better: Obama or McCain?<br /><br />That sure is a no-brainer!
Palin, by flailing around with her one-sided message, does nothing more than echo the narrow dreams of a reactionary side of America. She seems to be a part of a declining minority, but God help us all if she ever becomes part of the majority!
If anything, this adds an additional negative to that long-sought after legacy that the Bush administration has been vainly searching for.<br /><br />However, the now McCain led republicans certainly seem to wish a return to the Hoover era and apparently will welcome a depression/recession.<br /><br />It is time to get some people in Congress that represent something other than the Bush/McCain kind of friends and someone in the White House who represents something other than a Chicken Little style of administration.
So the GOP intends to repeat the Hoover-era blunders. Great Depression, here we come with Geezer and Gidget to help them along. Who said history will never repeat itself?
What I see in McCain and Palin is a rigidity of thought that precludes any ability to be flexible and adjust to changing situations. That was apparent in the "debate" last night and in the Palin comments.<br /><br />McCain reminds me of the generals in WWI that kept ordering their troops to charge an entrenched foe with barbed wire and machine guns, believing that one more effort would win the day. Palin is just mindless and capable of saying nothing more than the few talking points which she incoherently attempts to repeat.<br /><br />I would not want either one of them close to that red button and I would hope that the American electorate can come to grips with more than abortion as an issue, or we are going to suffer more of the same old same-o!
We are going on eight years of having incompetent and selfish "leadership." And, if the narrow-minded and bigoted have their way, we can enjoy some more similar years.<br /><br />I am wondering what it would be like to have someone leading this country that listens, has some orginal thoughts, exhibits empathy, and has read something other than his own book.
In the parlance of the best comparison that can be made for the Bush administration, "This is a fine kettle of fish that you have gotten us into!"<br /><br />Anyone for another Laurel and Hardy administration?
Do you realize how many of the king's men and king's horses are necessary to prop up the humpty-dumpty candidacy of McCain and Palin?<br /><br />...and they still keep falling off the wall.
Sounds to me that she carefully follows the script set forward by Dubya and his manipulative vice president. My God, haven't we learned our lesson, or are we doomed to repeat history?<br /><br />I wonder what kind of a role the first dude will have in any administration that she is a part of? Maybe he will just collect per diem, who knows?
Now we know why Palin was kept away from the media:<br /><br />Lightweight, INexperienced, and pedantic. My God, how many weeks has it taken to get her this far and memorize the lines she has to deliver.<br /><br />Now that, my friends, is a pig in a poke!
Geezer and Gidget, America's least known media interviewees. Hey, America, we will be anything you want up through election day. You people love a pig in a poke and we want to bring you as much mystery and/or misery as you can take. It's worked for the last eight years, so why not once again?
If McCain was sincere about eliminating rancor, he should have picked a more moderate spokesperson than Mrs. Attila the Hun. Gun-toting, right-wing, holier-than-thou, flat-world society, anti-environmentalists certainly do not promote the idea of bipartisanship. Maybe he means to change his spots after the election --but which way?
I would give Mr. McCain some credence if he was not so deeply in bed with the Bush handlers, the neocons, plus all of those that are so much identified with failed policies. He is going to have a hard time convincing me that he wants to be above the fray when his attack dogs are being unleashed.<br /><br />Right now, McCain represents hypocrisy at its worst.
Pregnancy issue: Not relevant<br /><br />Vetting issue: Significant<br /><br />McCain's role: Disturbing<br /><br />Palin's background: Even more disturbing<br /><br />The GOP: Too emotional and at a loss to be critical<br /><br />
Instructions:<br /><br />1. Look like a leader.<br /><br />2. Get pictures taken as often as possible.<br /><br />3. Don't get in way of people doing the real work.<br /><br />4. Avoid mentioning GOP disaster of Katrina.<br /><br />5. Don't comment on why FEMA has still not dealt with aftermath of Katrina.<br /><br />6. Look serious.<br /><br />7. Suggest a lot of prayer.<br /><br />8. Have them take a lot more pictures.<br /><br />9. Refrain from looking overjoyed with Bush-Cheyney not attending the convention.<br /><br />10. Take more pictures.
If anything, the Russian reaction has clearly pointed out that the Bush administration's bullying, sermonizing, inability to learn, and incapability of listening has been an utter failure and little Johnny McSame wants to follow in the same footsteps. It is so hard for the US to even suggest a moral position, when it has abandoned its higher ground.<br /><br />It seems that the only consistency left with this bankrupt administration is an insatiable desire to start World War III. What a legacy!
Congratulations, GOP! You have returned to your barefoot-and-pregnant philosophy. I guess it wasn't enough to wipe out the middle class. Maybe Cindy will get me a job at the brewery.
Ah, now I remember why they called American soldiers "baby killers" when they returned from Vietnam - it was because they were killing babies. Some things never change.
He may be insane when it comes to monetary policy, but he is ALSO insane when it comes to military adventurism and drug prohibition. Right now, "There is Reason for War" sounds good to me. Sadly, that stand is exactly why the he won't get elected.
The first thing to do is check to see if your wife is a robot.
