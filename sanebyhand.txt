I literally just came back from the King Memorial in Atlanta and logged in to find these news. RIP Rev. and thank you.
Since most employers are self funded for claim expenses the insurance companies aren't as directly impacted by changes in claim volume. Also, its a marketplace. The insurance companies risk losing business when they raise prices without a basis.
It really bothers me that the Times is reporting Obama's position as a hardline position, suggesting it is comparable to the position the Republicans have taken, most recently during the debt ceiling debacle. The R's have called for no increased taxes, period, and have taken an expansive view of wha
Mr. Krugman, you wrote a very thought provoking article. From a personal perspective, I have seen the power of nurses increase over the last 30 years. Their jobs can not be shipped out of the country, have a lot of manual labor and they are well trained and educated.I do dispute your suggestion that
One of the things I've been longing for over the last couple of years is to return to a walkable city. Now that my husband and I are planning our imminent move back to Washington, D.C., our top criteria for a new home is the ability to walk to our jobs, grocery stores, cafes, etc. I know we'll be he
My son was diagnosed at the age of 7 (after a three week evaluation at an outpatient psychiatric unit) with bi-polar disorder, OCD, generalized anxiety and ADHD. His psychiatrist specifically wanted to determine if he suffered from other disorders before considering treating ADHD with medication. Th
This is just too cool!
Amazon, for its own survival, must filter out biased reviews. I stopped using my Kindle about 6 months ago because I could not reliably find books worth reading using reviews on the Kindle store or the Amazon website. Just last evening my husband complained that he could find nothing he wanted to re
I'm a local and sometimes I like to get out of the city with my wife for a little weekend retreat. One of our favourites is a bed and breakfast called River Run Cottages. They're in Ladner and have one of those floating houses right on the Fraser River.Check out the website at www.riverruncottages.c
I hate waking up early, but early to rise makes the day more productive and more time to do important things.
Healthcare is not subject to normal market forces! Anything that you have to buy at any random moment in order not to die is not something to which a rational supply/demand calculus can apply. Check out "Penny Medical" articles on how to reduce the cost of insurance.
I disagreed with Christopher Hitchens on any number of issues, but I am furious that that excellent mind has ceased to be.
As the mother of two kids whom I adore truly, madly, and deeply, this task seems impossible. I will be thinking about this in coming days, months, years, I am sure. But for the moment, I would say that the most important wish I have for my children is that they be generous. Be generous! With whateve
It is important to note that, unlike other delegates, the DC delegate represents citizens who pay full federal taxes. DC Vote activists have asked Rep. Boehner to consider the District of Columbia separately from other territories represented by non-voting delegates.
He probably got tired of her telling him to turn down the music.
I don't appreciate having my tax dollars used to fund war. Most Christians and many of other faiths have this same conflict.Both war and abortion involve death and yet only the latter appears to have any voice with the media or receive any extra consideration from most of our representatives. I don'
Shoring up existing infrastructure in this country is certainly a priority. However, rather than building new highways, now may be a good time for stepping further into the green economy. More money should be spent on alternative energy, that much is clear. However, I'd like to make the radical sugg
I'm a Sox fan and even I regret Cone leaving. But it could have been worse. Singleton might have left in which case I'd be hitting the mute button for half the broadcast. Getting Kaat back? Great fantasy...but unfortunately that's only a little more likely than Phil and Bobby returning.
I came of age during the digital revolution. At 31 I can still remember learning how to use a card catalog. I also remember hearing a great song on the radio and heading out to spend 16.99 on the CD, and in many cases being extremely disappointed that that one great song was the only great song. I r
