War is dirty business. Those who "play by the rules" lose. There are always innocent people who are hurt and killed in all sorts of ways, most of which never see the light of day. What about Obama's promise to close Guantanamo? Why has Atty General Holder all of a sudden stopped pushing for granting
Only the religious right could scare-monger the public with the specter of Shariah Law and, at the same time, argue that there should be no separation between religion and government. What flim flam.
Amen, amen, and amen!
The party that controls the electronic voting machines controls the outcome.
This court does not deserve our respect and much less our trust. Something HAS to be done. Clarence Thomas and his wife have been openly "purchased" by the economic elites- much like most of our "elected representatives" have been. The idealism and reason of our founding fathers as well as all the m
And citizens. Republicans absolutely hate American citizens.
#1, you left out the following reasons for the shortage of hangmen (or hangPERSONS, to be politically correct); corporate greed, Big Oil, climate change, and Sarah Palin's web site.
I guess the guy wants to be sure that he lunches only with his white cronies and the slaves are kept in the kitchen. Kentucky can keep him but please do not unleash him on the rest of us.
Hillary is too much a principled hawk, and least to understand wider issues to be considered as President. Gifted yes, but not in this role.
Remember that Al Gore said that the sea level would have raised by 20 feet by now. You must follow the money, and the money behind all of this scientific mumbo jumbo comes from Siemens a.g. and GE, the two companies that would profit the most if the US tries to limit CO2 emissions.
This thing primarily seems to be a punitive jihad against Wall Street by the same small-minded imams who brought us the stimulus and health care bills. The common thread is that they all largely miss the big-picture structural point, presumably because the administration and Congressional leadership
Steal? Didn't the Chinese Communists ISSUE the NY Times staff their passwords?Remember Walter Duranty?
Pretty thin gruel, even for the Rove types.Seems more a pathetic out of touch stretch than a fruitful strategy.It invites the public to draw comparisons between the missteps in Benghazi by the Obama administration, and the tragic serial incompetence by the Bush administration in the middle east, if 
Any GOP clown calling Obama an elitist cannot be taken seriously. Underneath the absurd GOP resistance to Anything Obama is an ugly racism, not even thinly disguised.
The ultimate religious insanity group.
EEK - I don't get it - hooks and cheeks?HYPNOTIZED was one of the last to go, because I finally remembered TERZA RIMA. Great clue ("open to suggestion," I mean, but I always like a little Dante in my puzzles, too)! I was fooled once again by "summers" - never again, she said. . .I agree about HIT OR
Well, the Princeton elite certainly live in a world different from those of us who have jobs. This is from the same man who thinks that having the government prescribe the details of your health insurance policy (including details that destroy its value as insurance, that is, something that manages 
"We are to believe that Southern independence did not depend on slavery, I suppose?" *That* is precisely what Davis was saying in *1864*. Sesquicentennial historians commonly extend Lincoln the privilege of changing his War aims, but not Davis. It is fallacious and hypocritical, but conforms to thei
Hey, don't you know that Republicans aren't ALLOWED to speak their minds?
With information obtained through morally repugnant enhanced interrogation techniques (including water boarding) in foreign Rendition Prisons and at Guantanamo Bay and Intel gathered from illegal wiretaps, the President of the United States ordered the military invasion of an ally and the execution 
We're GOING to have forced sterilizations. No question of it. It's just a matter of whether we will take these measures while we still have a chance of surviving or after it is already too late to halt the inevitable.
"The answer is yes, but" Sure but only if they are Muslim "Americans" bent on subverting and destroying our western. Christian, society.
The communist Chinese dictatorship owns the world, including most of the United States. What could the piddly little U.S. do to stop them? In fact,WE Americans are junkies for all the cheap Chinese junk sold in our stores...and our Chinese pushers are only too happy to supply us. Oh how the opium wa
